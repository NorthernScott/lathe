    """Fetch an attribute ``name`` from ``globals()`` and warn if it's from a deprecated module.

    Note that ``__getattr__()`` only gets called when ``name`` is missing
    from the module's globals. The trick is that we want to import this
    function into other deprecated modules, and we want to carry this
    subpackage's globals along to prevent some spurious warnings.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If the attribute is not found in ``globals()`` and also could not be
        imported from the modules in ``_MODULES``.

    PyVistaDeprecationWarning
        If the attribute has been found via importing from the modules in
        ``_MODULES``, as this implies that the feature has been moved from
        pyvista.utilities.
