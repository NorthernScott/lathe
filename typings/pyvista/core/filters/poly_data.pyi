        .. versionchanged:: 0.39.0
            Before version ``0.39.0``, if all input datasets were of type :class:`pyvista.PolyData`,
            the VTK ``vtkAppendPolyDataFilter`` and ``vtkCleanPolyData`` filters were used to perform merging.
            Otherwise, :func:`DataSetFilters.merge`, which uses the VTK ``vtkAppendFilter`` filter,
            was called.
            To enhance performance and coherence with merging operations available for other datasets in pyvista,
            the merging operation has been delegated in ``0.39.0`` to :func:`DataSetFilters.merge` only,
            irrespectively of input datasets types.
            This induced that points ordering can be altered compared to previous pyvista versions when
            merging only PolyData together.
            To obtain similar results as before ``0.39.0`` for multiple PolyData, combine
            :func:`PolyDataFilters.append_polydata` and :func:`PolyDataFilters.clean`.

        merge_points : bool, optional

        tolerance : float, default: 0.0
            The absolute tolerance to use to find coincident points when
            ``merge_points=True``.

        inplace : bool, default: False
            Updates grid inplace when ``True`` if the input type is a
            :class:`pyvista.PolyData`. For other input meshes the
            result is a :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid` which makes
            in-place operation impossible.

        main_has_priority : bool, optional
            When this parameter is ``True`` and ``merge_points=True``,
            the arrays of the merging grids will be overwritten
            by the original main mesh.

            Number of iterations for Laplacian smoothing.

        relaxation_factor : float, default: 0.01
            Relaxation factor controls the amount of displacement in a single

            iterations is numerically more stable.

        convergence : float, default: 0.0
            Convergence criterion for the iteration process. Smaller numbers
            result in more smoothing iterations. Range from (0 to 1).

        edge_angle : float, default: 15
            Edge angle to control smoothing along edges (either interior or boundary).

        feature_angle : float, default: 45
            Feature angle for sharp edge identification.

        boundary_smoothing : bool, default: True
            Flag to control smoothing of boundary edges. When ``True``,
            boundary edges remain fixed.

        feature_smoothing : bool, default: False
            Flag to control smoothing of feature edges.  When ``True``,

        This filter allows you to smooth the mesh as in the Laplacian smoothing

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_iter : int, default: 20
            This is the degree of the polynomial used to approximate the

        pass_band : float, default: 0.1
            The passband value for the windowed sinc filter. This should be
            between 0 and 2, where lower values cause more smoothing.

        edge_angle : float, default: 15.0
            Edge angle to control smoothing along edges (either interior or
            boundary).

        feature_angle : float, default: 45.0
            Feature angle for sharp edge identification.

        boundary_smoothing : bool, default: True
            Flag to control smoothing of boundary edges. When ``True``,
            boundary edges remain fixed.

        feature_smoothing : bool, default: False
            Flag to control smoothing of feature edges.  When ``True``,
            boundary edges remain fixed as defined by ``feature_angle`` and

        non_manifold_smoothing : bool, default: False
            Smooth non-manifold points.

        normalize_coordinates : bool, default: False
            Flag to control coordinate normalization. To improve the
            numerical stability of the solution and minimize the scaling of the
            translation effects, the algorithm can translate and scale the
            position coordinates to within the unit cube ``[-1, 1]``, perform the
            smoothing, and translate and scale the position coordinates back to
            the original coordinate frame.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reduction : float
            Reduction factor. A value of 0.9 will leave 10% of the
            original number of vertices.

        feature_angle : float, default: 45.0
            Angle used to define what an edge is (i.e., if the surface
            normal between two adjacent triangles is >= ``feature_angle``,
            an edge exists).

        split_angle : float, default: 75.0
            Angle used to control the splitting of the mesh. A split
            line exists when the surface normals between two edge

        splitting : bool, default: True
            Controls the splitting of the mesh at corners, along
            edges, at non-manifold points, or anywhere else a split is
            required. Turning splitting off will better preserve the
            original topology of the mesh, but may not necessarily
            give the exact requested decimation.

        pre_split_mesh : bool, default: False
            Separates the mesh into semi-planar patches, which are
            disconnected from each other. This can give superior
            results in some cases. If ``pre_split_mesh`` is set to
            ``True``, the mesh is split with the specified
            ``split_angle``. Otherwise mesh splitting is deferred as
            long as possible.

        preserve_topology : bool, default: False
            Controls topology preservation. If on, mesh splitting and
            hole elimination will not occur. This may limit the
            maximum reduction that may be achieved.

        boundary_vertex_deletion : bool, default: True
            Allow deletion of vertices on the boundary of the mesh.
            Turning this off may limit the maximum reduction that may
            be achieved.

        max_degree : float, optional
            The maximum vertex degree. If the number of triangles
            connected to a vertex exceeds ``max_degree``, then the
            vertex will be split. The complexity of the triangulation
            algorithm is proportional to ``max_degree**2``. Setting ``max_degree``
            small can improve the performance of the algorithm.

        inplace : bool, default: False
            Whether to update the mesh in-place.

        This filter uses a simple case-based, multi-pass approach to

        (i.e., two triangles replace the original one) to four.

        Point and cell data is treated as follows: The cell data from

        max_n_tris : int, optional
            The maximum number of triangles that can be created. If

        max_n_passes : int, optional
            The maximum number of passes (i.e., levels of

        """Compute point and/or cell normals for a mesh.

        The filter can reorder polygons to insure consistent
        orientation across polygon neighbors. Sharp edges can be split
        and points duplicated with separate normals to give crisp
        (rendered) surface definition. It is also possible to globally
        flip the normal orientation.

        The algorithm works by determining normals for each polygon
        and then averaging them at shared points. When sharp edges are
        present, the edges are split and new points generated to
        prevent blurry edges (due to Phong shading).

        An array named ``"Normals"`` is stored with the mesh.

        .. warning::

           - Normals can only be computed for polygons and triangle strips. Point clouds are not supported.
           - Triangle strips are broken up into triangle polygons. You may want to restrip the triangles.
           - Previous arrays named ``"Normals"`` will be overwritten.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cell_normals : bool, default: True
            Calculation of cell normals.

        point_normals : bool, default: True
            Calculation of point normals.

        split_vertices : bool, default: False
            Splitting of sharp edges. Indices to the original points are
            tracked in the ``"pyvistaOriginalPointIds"`` array.

        flip_normals : bool, default: False
            Set global flipping of normal orientation. Flipping
            modifies both the normal direction and the order of a
            cell's points.

        consistent_normals : bool, default: True
            Enforcement of consistent polygon ordering.

        auto_orient_normals : bool, default: False
            Turn on/off the automatic determination of correct normal
            orientation. NOTE: This assumes a completely closed
            surface (i.e. no boundary edges) and no non-manifold
            edges. If these constraints do not hold, all bets are
            off. This option adds some computational complexity, and
            is useful if you do not want to have to inspect the
            rendered image to determine whether to turn on the
            ``flip_normals`` flag.  However, this flag can work with
            the ``flip_normals`` flag, and if both are set, all the
            normals in the output will point "inward".

        non_manifold_traversal : bool, default: True
            Turn on/off traversal across non-manifold edges. Changing
            this may prevent problems where the consistency of
            polygonal ordering is corrupted due to topological
            loops.

        feature_angle : float, default: 30.0
            The angle that defines a sharp edge. If the difference in
            angle across neighboring polygons is greater than this
            value, the shared edge is considered "sharp".

        inplace : bool, default: False
            Updates mesh in-place.

        progress_bar : bool, default: False
            Display a progress bar to indicate progress.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the mesh contains only ``LINE`` or ``VERTEX`` cell types. Normals cannot be computed for these cells.

        Returns
        -------
        pyvista.PolyData
            Updated mesh with cell and point normals.

        See Also
        --------
        point_normals
            Returns the array of point normals.
        cell_normals

        Examples

        Alternatively, create a new mesh when computing the normals
        and compute both cell and point normals.

        >>> import pyvista as pv
        >>> sphere = pv.Sphere()
        >>> sphere_with_norm = sphere.compute_normals()

        tol : float, default: 1e-05

        alpha : float, default: 0.0
            Specify alpha (or distance) value to control output of
            this filter. For a non-zero alpha value, only edges or

            Boolean controls whether bounding triangulation points
            and associated triangles are included in the

            to begin the triangulation process. This feature is nice

        int

        Notes
        -----
        Due to the nature of the `vtk.vtkCollisionDetectionFilter
        <https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCollisionDetectionFilter.html>`_,
        repeated uses of this method will be slower that using the
        ``vtk.vtkCollisionDetectionFilter`` directly.  The first
        update of the filter creates two instances of `vtkOBBTree
        <https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkOBBTree.html>`_,
        which can be subsequently updated by modifying the transform or
        matrix of the input meshes.

        This method assumes no transform and is easier to use for
        single collision tests, but it is recommended to use a
        combination of ``pyvista`` and ``vtk`` for rapidly computing
        repeated collisions.  See the `Collision Detection Example
        <https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/Python/Visualization/CollisionDetection/>`_

        Examples
        --------
        Compute the collision between a sphere and the back faces of a
        cube and output the cell indices of the first 10 collisions.

        >>> import numpy as np

        >>> mesh_a = pv.Sphere(radius=0.5)
        >>> mesh_b = pv.Cube((0.5, 0.5, 0.5)).extract_cells([0, 2, 4])
        >>> collision, ncol = mesh_a.collision(mesh_b, cell_tolerance=1)
        >>> collision['ContactCells'][:10]
        pyvista_ndarray([464,   0,   0,  29,  29,  27,  27,  28,  28,  23])

        Plot the collisions by creating a collision mask with the
        ``"ContactCells"`` field data.  Cells with a collision are
        colored red.

        >>> scalars = np.zeros(collision.n_cells, dtype=bool)
        >>> scalars[collision.field_data['ContactCells']] = True
        >>> pl = pv.Plotter()
        >>> _ = pl.add_mesh(
        ...     collision,
        ...     scalars=scalars,
        ...     show_scalar_bar=False,

        ...     opacity=0.7,
        ...     show_edges=True,
        ... )
        >>> pl.show()

        Alternatively, simply plot the collisions using the default
        ``'collision_rgba'`` array after enabling ``generate_scalars``.

        >>> collision, ncol = mesh_a.collision(

        scalar_mode : str, default: 'value'
            Control whether the cell scalars are output as an integer index or
            a scalar value.  If ``'index'``, the index refers to the bands
            produced by the clipping range. If ``'value'``, then a scalar value
            which is a value between clip values is used.

        clipping : bool, default: True
            Indicate whether to clip outside ``rng`` and only return cells with
            values within ``rng``.

        progress_bar : bool, default: False

            This filter will assume that the input polygons lie in the same
