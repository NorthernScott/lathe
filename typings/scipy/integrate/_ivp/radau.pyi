class Radau(OdeSolver):
    """Implicit Runge-Kutta method of Radau IIA family of order 5.

    The implementation follows [1]_. The error is controlled with a
    third-order accurate embedded formula. A cubic polynomial which satisfies
    the collocation conditions is used for the dense output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Right-hand side of the system: the time derivative of the state ``y``
        at time ``t``. The calling signature is ``fun(t, y)``, where ``t`` is a
        scalar and ``y`` is an ndarray with ``len(y) = len(y0)``. ``fun`` must
        return an array of the same shape as ``y``. See `vectorized` for more
        information.
    t0 : float
        Initial time.
    y0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial state.
    t_bound : float
        Boundary time - the integration won't continue beyond it. It also
        determines the direction of the integration.
    first_step : float or None, optional
        Initial step size. Default is ``None`` which means that the algorithm
        should choose.
    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is np.inf, i.e., the step size is not
        bounded and determined solely by the solver.
    rtol, atol : float and array_like, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerances. The solver keeps the local error
        estimates less than ``atol + rtol * abs(y)``. HHere `rtol` controls a
        relative accuracy (number of correct digits), while `atol` controls
        absolute accuracy (number of correct decimal places). To achieve the
        desired `rtol`, set `atol` to be smaller than the smallest value that
        can be expected from ``rtol * abs(y)`` so that `rtol` dominates the
        allowable error. If `atol` is larger than ``rtol * abs(y)`` the
        number of correct digits is not guaranteed. Conversely, to achieve the
        desired `atol` set `rtol` such that ``rtol * abs(y)`` is always smaller
        than `atol`. If components of y have different scales, it might be
        beneficial to set different `atol` values for different components by
        passing array_like with shape (n,) for `atol`. Default values are
        1e-3 for `rtol` and 1e-6 for `atol`.
    jac : {None, array_like, sparse_matrix, callable}, optional
        Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side of the system with respect to
        y, required by this method. The Jacobian matrix has shape (n, n) and
        its element (i, j) is equal to ``d f_i / d y_j``.
        There are three ways to define the Jacobian:

            * If array_like or sparse_matrix, the Jacobian is assumed to
              be constant.
            * If callable, the Jacobian is assumed to depend on both
              t and y; it will be called as ``jac(t, y)`` as necessary.
              For the 'Radau' and 'BDF' methods, the return value might be a
              sparse matrix.
            * If None (default), the Jacobian will be approximated by
              finite differences.

        It is generally recommended to provide the Jacobian rather than
        relying on a finite-difference approximation.
    jac_sparsity : {None, array_like, sparse matrix}, optional
        Defines a sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix for a
        finite-difference approximation. Its shape must be (n, n). This argument
        is ignored if `jac` is not `None`. If the Jacobian has only few non-zero
        elements in *each* row, providing the sparsity structure will greatly
        speed up the computations [2]_. A zero entry means that a corresponding
        element in the Jacobian is always zero. If None (default), the Jacobian
        is assumed to be dense.
    vectorized : bool, optional
        Whether `fun` can be called in a vectorized fashion. Default is False.

        If ``vectorized`` is False, `fun` will always be called with ``y`` of
        shape ``(n,)``, where ``n = len(y0)``.

        If ``vectorized`` is True, `fun` may be called with ``y`` of shape
        ``(n, k)``, where ``k`` is an integer. In this case, `fun` must behave
        such that ``fun(t, y)[:, i] == fun(t, y[:, i])`` (i.e. each column of
        the returned array is the time derivative of the state corresponding
        with a column of ``y``).

        Setting ``vectorized=True`` allows for faster finite difference
        approximation of the Jacobian by this method, but may result in slower
        execution overall in some circumstances (e.g. small ``len(y0)``).
