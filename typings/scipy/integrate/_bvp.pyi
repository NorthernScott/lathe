    Here x is a 1-D independent variable, y(x) is an n-D

    determined, there must be n + k boundary conditions, i.e., bc must be an
    (n + k)-D function.

    The last singular term on the right-hand side of the system is optional.
    It is defined by an n-by-n matrix S, such that the solution must satisfy
    S y(a) = 0. This condition will be forced during iterations, so it must not
    contradict boundary conditions. See [2]_ for the explanation how this term
    is handled when solving BVPs numerically.

    Problems in a complex domain can be solved as well. In this case, y and p
    are considered to be complex, and f and bc are assumed to be complex-valued
    functions, but x stays real. Note that f and bc must be complex
    differentiable (satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equations [4]_), otherwise you
    should rewrite your problem for real and imaginary parts separately. To
    solve a problem in a complex domain, pass an initial guess for y with a
    complex data type (see below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Right-hand side of the system. The calling signature is ``fun(x, y)``,
        or ``fun(x, y, p)`` if parameters are present. All arguments are
        ndarray: ``x`` with shape (m,), ``y`` with shape (n, m), meaning that
        ``y[:, i]`` corresponds to ``x[i]``, and ``p`` with shape (k,). The
        return value must be an array with shape (n, m) and with the same
        layout as ``y``.
    bc : callable
        Function evaluating residuals of the boundary conditions. The calling
        signature is ``bc(ya, yb)``, or ``bc(ya, yb, p)`` if parameters are
        present. All arguments are ndarray: ``ya`` and ``yb`` with shape (n,),
        and ``p`` with shape (k,). The return value must be an array with
        shape (n + k,).
    x : array_like, shape (m,)
        Initial mesh. Must be a strictly increasing sequence of real numbers
        with ``x[0]=a`` and ``x[-1]=b``.
    y : array_like, shape (n, m)
        Initial guess for the function values at the mesh nodes, ith column
        corresponds to ``x[i]``. For problems in a complex domain pass `y`
        with a complex data type (even if the initial guess is purely real).
    p : array_like with shape (k,) or None, optional
        Initial guess for the unknown parameters. If None (default), it is
        assumed that the problem doesn't depend on any parameters.
    S : array_like with shape (n, n) or None
        Matrix defining the singular term. If None (default), the problem is
        solved without the singular term.
    fun_jac : callable or None, optional
        Function computing derivatives of f with respect to y and p. The
        calling signature is ``fun_jac(x, y)``, or ``fun_jac(x, y, p)`` if
        parameters are present. The return must contain 1 or 2 elements in the
        following order:

            * df_dy : array_like with shape (n, n, m), where an element
              (i, j, q) equals to d f_i(x_q, y_q, p) / d (y_q)_j.
            * df_dp : array_like with shape (n, k, m), where an element
              (i, j, q) equals to d f_i(x_q, y_q, p) / d p_j.

        Here q numbers nodes at which x and y are defined, whereas i and j
        number vector components. If the problem is solved without unknown
        parameters, df_dp should not be returned.

        If `fun_jac` is None (default), the derivatives will be estimated
        by the forward finite differences.
    bc_jac : callable or None, optional
        Function computing derivatives of bc with respect to ya, yb, and p.
        The calling signature is ``bc_jac(ya, yb)``, or ``bc_jac(ya, yb, p)``
        if parameters are present. The return must contain 2 or 3 elements in
        the following order:

            * dbc_dya : array_like with shape (n, n), where an element (i, j)
              equals to d bc_i(ya, yb, p) / d ya_j.
            * dbc_dyb : array_like with shape (n, n), where an element (i, j)
              equals to d bc_i(ya, yb, p) / d yb_j.
            * dbc_dp : array_like with shape (n, k), where an element (i, j)
              equals to d bc_i(ya, yb, p) / d p_j.

        If the problem is solved without unknown parameters, dbc_dp should not
        be returned.

        If `bc_jac` is None (default), the derivatives will be estimated by
        the forward finite differences.
    tol : float, optional
        Desired tolerance of the solution. If we define ``r = y' - f(x, y)``,
        where y is the found solution, then the solver tries to achieve on each
        mesh interval ``norm(r / (1 + abs(f)) < tol``, where ``norm`` is
        estimated in a root mean squared sense (using a numerical quadrature
        formula). Default is 1e-3.
    max_nodes : int, optional
        Maximum allowed number of the mesh nodes. If exceeded, the algorithm
        terminates. Default is 1000.
    verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
        Level of algorithm's verbosity:

            * 0 (default) : work silently.
            * 1 : display a termination report.
            * 2 : display progress during iterations.
    bc_tol : float, optional
        Desired absolute tolerance for the boundary condition residuals: `bc`
        value should satisfy ``abs(bc) < bc_tol`` component-wise.
        Equals to `tol` by default. Up to 10 iterations are allowed to achieve this
        tolerance.

    Returns
    -------
    Bunch object with the following fields defined:
    sol : PPoly
        Found solution for y as `scipy.interpolate.PPoly` instance, a C1
        continuous cubic spline.
    p : ndarray or None, shape (k,)
        Found parameters. None, if the parameters were not present in the
        problem.
    x : ndarray, shape (m,)
        Nodes of the final mesh.
    y : ndarray, shape (n, m)
        Solution values at the mesh nodes.
    yp : ndarray, shape (n, m)
        Solution derivatives at the mesh nodes.
    rms_residuals : ndarray, shape (m - 1,)
        RMS values of the relative residuals over each mesh interval (see the
        description of `tol` parameter).
    niter : int
        Number of completed iterations.
    status : int
        Reason for algorithm termination:

            * 0: The algorithm converged to the desired accuracy.
            * 1: The maximum number of mesh nodes is exceeded.
            * 2: A singular Jacobian encountered when solving the collocation
              system.

    message : string
        Verbal description of the termination reason.
    success : bool
        True if the algorithm converged to the desired accuracy (``status=0``).

    Notes
    -----
    This function implements a 4th order collocation algorithm with the
    control of residuals similar to [1]_. A collocation system is solved
    by a damped Newton method with an affine-invariant criterion function as
    described in [3]_.

    Note that in [1]_  integral residuals are defined without normalization
    by interval lengths. So, their definition is different by a multiplier of
    h**0.5 (h is an interval length) from the definition used here.

    Examples
    --------
    In the first example, we solve Bratu's problem::

        y'' + k * exp(y) = 0
        y(0) = y(1) = 0

    for k = 1.

    We rewrite the equation as a first-order system and implement its
    right-hand side evaluation::

        y1' = y2
        y2' = -exp(y1)

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> def fun(x, y):
    ...     return np.vstack((y[1], -np.exp(y[0])))

    Implement evaluation of the boundary condition residuals:

    >>> def bc(ya, yb):
    ...     return np.array([ya[0], yb[0]])

    Define the initial mesh with 5 nodes:

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)

    This problem is known to have two solutions. To obtain both of them, we
    use two different initial guesses for y. We denote them by subscripts
    a and b.

    >>> y_a = np.zeros((2, x.size))
    >>> y_b = np.zeros((2, x.size))
    >>> y_b[0] = 3

    Now we are ready to run the solver.

    >>> res_a = solve_bvp(fun, bc, x, y_a)
    >>> res_b = solve_bvp(fun, bc, x, y_b)

    Let's plot the two found solutions. We take an advantage of having the
    solution in a spline form to produce a smooth plot.

    >>> x_plot = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
    >>> y_plot_a = res_a.sol(x_plot)[0]
    >>> y_plot_b = res_b.sol(x_plot)[0]
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot_a, label='y_a')
    >>> plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot_b, label='y_b')
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.xlabel("x")
    >>> plt.ylabel("y")
    >>> plt.show()

    We see that the two solutions have similar shape, but differ in scale
    significantly.

    In the second example, we solve a simple Sturm-Liouville problem::

        y'' + k**2 * y = 0
        y(0) = y(1) = 0

    It is known that a non-trivial solution y = A * sin(k * x) is possible for
    k = pi * n, where n is an integer. To establish the normalization constant
    A = 1 we add a boundary condition::

        y'(0) = k

    Again, we rewrite our equation as a first-order system and implement its
    right-hand side evaluation::

        y1' = y2
        y2' = -k**2 * y1

    >>> def fun(x, y, p):
    ...     k = p[0]
    ...     return np.vstack((y[1], -k**2 * y[0]))

    Note that parameters p are passed as a vector (with one element in our
    case).

    Implement the boundary conditions:

    >>> def bc(ya, yb, p):
    ...     k = p[0]
    ...     return np.array([ya[0], yb[0], ya[1] - k])

    Set up the initial mesh and guess for y. We aim to find the solution for
    k = 2 * pi, to achieve that we set values of y to approximately follow
    sin(2 * pi * x):

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
    >>> y = np.zeros((2, x.size))
    >>> y[0, 1] = 1
    >>> y[0, 3] = -1

    Run the solver with 6 as an initial guess for k.

    >>> sol = solve_bvp(fun, bc, x, y, p=[6])

    We see that the found k is approximately correct:

    >>> sol.p[0]
    6.28329460046

    And, finally, plot the solution to see the anticipated sinusoid:

    >>> x_plot = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
    >>> y_plot = sol.sol(x_plot)[0]
    >>> plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot)
    >>> plt.xlabel("x")
    >>> plt.ylabel("y")
    >>> plt.show()
    """
