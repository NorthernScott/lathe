First-order ODE integrators.

User-friendly interface to various numerical integrators for solving a
system of first order ODEs with prescribed initial conditions::

    d y(t)[i]
    ---------  = f(t,y(t))[i],
       d t

    y(t=0)[i] = y0[i],

where::

    i = 0, ..., len(y0) - 1

class ode
---------

A generic interface class to numeric integrators. It has the following
methods::

    integrator = ode(f, jac=None)
    integrator = integrator.set_integrator(name, **params)
    integrator = integrator.set_initial_value(y0, t0=0.0)
    integrator = integrator.set_f_params(*args)
    integrator = integrator.set_jac_params(*args)
    y1 = integrator.integrate(t1, step=False, relax=False)
    flag = integrator.successful()

class complex_ode
-----------------

This class has the same generic interface as ode, except it can handle complex
f, y and Jacobians by transparently translating them into the equivalent
real-valued system. It supports the real-valued solvers (i.e., not zvode) and is
an alternative to ode with the zvode solver, sometimes performing better.

    A generic interface class to numeric integrators.

    Solve an equation system :math:`y'(t) = f(t,y)` with (optional) ``jac = df/dy``.

    *Note*: The first two arguments of ``f(t, y, ...)`` are in the
    opposite order of the arguments in the system definition function used
    by `scipy.integrate.odeint`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable ``f(t, y, *f_args)``

        ``y.shape == (n,)``.
        ``f_args`` is set by calling ``set_f_params(*args)``.
        `f` should return a scalar, array or list (not a tuple).
    jac : callable ``jac(t, y, *jac_args)``, optional
        Jacobian of the right-hand side, ``jac[i,j] = d f[i] / d y[j]``.
        ``jac_args`` is set by calling ``set_jac_params(*args)``.

    Attributes
    ----------

    Notes
    -----
    Available integrators are listed below. They can be selected using
    the `set_integrator` method.

    "vode"

        Real-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation
        solver, with fixed-leading-coefficient implementation. It provides
        implicit Adams method (for non-stiff problems) and a method based on
        backward differentiation formulas (BDF) (for stiff problems).

        Source: http://www.netlib.org/ode/vode.f

        .. warning::

           This integrator is not re-entrant. You cannot have two `ode`
           instances using the "vode" integrator at the same time.

        This integrator accepts the following parameters in `set_integrator`
        method of the `ode` class:

        - atol : float or sequence
          absolute tolerance for solution
        - rtol : float or sequence
          relative tolerance for solution
        - lband : None or int
        - uband : None or int
          Jacobian band width, jac[i,j] != 0 for i-lband <= j <= i+uband.
          Setting these requires your jac routine to return the jacobian
          in packed format, jac_packed[i-j+uband, j] = jac[i,j]. The
          dimension of the matrix must be (lband+uband+1, len(y)).
        - method: 'adams' or 'bdf'
          Which solver to use, Adams (non-stiff) or BDF (stiff)
        - with_jacobian : bool
          This option is only considered when the user has not supplied a
          Jacobian function and has not indicated (by setting either band)
          that the Jacobian is banded. In this case, `with_jacobian` specifies
          whether the iteration method of the ODE solver's correction step is
          chord iteration with an internally generated full Jacobian or
          functional iteration with no Jacobian.
        - nsteps : int
          Maximum number of (internally defined) steps allowed during one
          call to the solver.
        - first_step : float
        - min_step : float
        - max_step : float
          Limits for the step sizes used by the integrator.
        - order : int
          Maximum order used by the integrator,
          order <= 12 for Adams, <= 5 for BDF.

    "zvode"

        Complex-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation
        solver, with fixed-leading-coefficient implementation. It provides
        implicit Adams method (for non-stiff problems) and a method based on
        backward differentiation formulas (BDF) (for stiff problems).

        Source: http://www.netlib.org/ode/zvode.f

        .. warning::

           This integrator is not re-entrant. You cannot have two `ode`
           instances using the "zvode" integrator at the same time.

        This integrator accepts the same parameters in `set_integrator`
        as the "vode" solver.

        .. note::

            When using ZVODE for a stiff system, it should only be used for
            the case in which the function f is analytic, that is, when each f(i)
            is an analytic function of each y(j). Analyticity means that the
            partial derivative df(i)/dy(j) is a unique complex number, and this
            fact is critical in the way ZVODE solves the dense or banded linear
            systems that arise in the stiff case. For a complex stiff ODE system
            in which f is not analytic, ZVODE is likely to have convergence
            failures, and for this problem one should instead use DVODE on the
            equivalent real system (in the real and imaginary parts of y).

    "lsoda"

        Real-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation
        solver, with fixed-leading-coefficient implementation. It provides
        automatic method switching between implicit Adams method (for non-stiff
        problems) and a method based on backward differentiation formulas (BDF)
        (for stiff problems).

          Maximum order used in the stiff case (default 5).
        - max_hnil : int
          Maximum number of messages reporting too small step size (t + h = t)
          (default 0)

        relax : bool
            If True and if the integrator supports the run_relax method,
            then integrate until t_1 >= t and return. ``relax`` is not
            referenced if ``step=True``.
            This parameter is provided in order to expose internals of
            the implementation, and should not be changed from its default
            value in most cases.

        Returns
        -------
        y : float
            The integrated value at t

        Parameters
        ----------
        solout : callable
            ``solout(t, y)`` is called at each internal integrator step,
            t is a scalar providing the current independent position
            y is the current solution ``y.shape == (n,)``
            solout should return -1 to stop integration
            otherwise it should return None or 0
