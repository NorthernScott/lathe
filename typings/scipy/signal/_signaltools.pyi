def correlate(in1, in2, mode=..., method=...): # -> NDArray[Any]:
    r"""
    Cross-correlate two N-dimensional arrays.

    Cross-correlate `in1` and `in2`, with the output size determined by the
    `mode` argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in1 : array_like
        First input.
    in2 : array_like
        Second input. Should have the same number of dimensions as `in1`.
    mode : str {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional
        A string indicating the size of the output:

        ``full``
           The output is the full discrete linear cross-correlation
           of the inputs. (Default)
        ``valid``
           The output consists only of those elements that do not
           rely on the zero-padding. In 'valid' mode, either `in1` or `in2`
           must be at least as large as the other in every dimension.
        ``same``
           The output is the same size as `in1`, centered
           with respect to the 'full' output.
    method : str {'auto', 'direct', 'fft'}, optional
        A string indicating which method to use to calculate the correlation.

        ``direct``
           The correlation is determined directly from sums, the definition of
           correlation.
        ``fft``
           The Fast Fourier Transform is used to perform the correlation more
           quickly (only available for numerical arrays.)
        ``auto``
           Automatically chooses direct or Fourier method based on an estimate
           of which is faster (default).  See `convolve` Notes for more detail.

           .. versionadded:: 0.19.0

    Returns
    -------
    correlate : array
        An N-dimensional array containing a subset of the discrete linear
        cross-correlation of `in1` with `in2`.

    See Also
    --------
    choose_conv_method : contains more documentation on `method`.
    correlation_lags : calculates the lag / displacement indices array for 1D
        cross-correlation.

    Notes
    -----
    The correlation z of two d-dimensional arrays x and y is defined as::

        z[...,k,...] = sum[..., i_l, ...] x[..., i_l,...] * conj(y[..., i_l - k,...])

    This way, if x and y are 1-D arrays and ``z = correlate(x, y, 'full')``
    then

    .. math::

          z[k] = (x * y)(k - N + 1)
               = \sum_{l=0}^{||x||-1}x_l y_{l-k+N-1}^{*}

    for :math:`k = 0, 1, ..., ||x|| + ||y|| - 2`

    where :math:`||x||` is the length of ``x``, :math:`N = \max(||x||,||y||)`,
    and :math:`y_m` is 0 when m is outside the range of y.

    ``method='fft'`` only works for numerical arrays as it relies on
    `fftconvolve`. In certain cases (i.e., arrays of objects or when
    rounding integers can lose precision), ``method='direct'`` is always used.

    When using "same" mode with even-length inputs, the outputs of `correlate`
    and `correlate2d` differ: There is a 1-index offset between them.

    --------
    Implement a matched filter using cross-correlation, to recover a signal

    Find the fastest convolution/correlation method.

    This primarily exists to be called during the ``method='auto'`` option in
    `convolve` and `correlate`. It can also be used to determine the value of
    ``method`` for many different convolutions of the same dtype/shape.
    In addition, it supports timing the convolution to adapt the value of
    ``method`` to a particular set of inputs and/or hardware.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in1 : array_like
        The first argument passed into the convolution function.
    in2 : array_like
        The second argument passed into the convolution function.
    mode : str {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional
        A string indicating the size of the output:

        ``full``
           The output is the full discrete linear convolution
           of the inputs. (Default)
        ``valid``
           The output consists only of those elements that do not
           rely on the zero-padding.
        ``same``
           The output is the same size as `in1`, centered
           with respect to the 'full' output.
    measure : bool, optional
        If True, run and time the convolution of `in1` and `in2` with both
        methods and return the fastest. If False (default), predict the fastest
        method using precomputed values.

    Returns
    -------
    method : str
        A string indicating which convolution method is fastest, either
        'direct' or 'fft'
    times : dict, optional
        A dictionary containing the times (in seconds) needed for each method.
        This value is only returned if ``measure=True``.

    correlate

    Notes
    -----
    Generally, this method is 99% accurate for 2D signals and 85% accurate
    for 1D signals for randomly chosen input sizes. For precision, use
    ``measure=True`` to find the fastest method by timing the convolution.
    This can be used to avoid the minimal overhead of finding the fastest
    ``method`` later, or to adapt the value of ``method`` to a particular set
    of inputs.

    Experiments were run on an Amazon EC2 r5a.2xlarge machine to test this
    function. These experiments measured the ratio between the time required
    when using ``method='auto'`` and the time required for the fastest method
    (i.e., ``ratio = time_auto / min(time_fft, time_direct)``). In these
    experiments, we found:

    * There is a 95% chance of this ratio being less than 1.5 for 1D signals
      and a 99% chance of being less than 2.5 for 2D signals.
    * The ratio was always less than 2.5/5 for 1D/2D signals respectively.
    * This function is most inaccurate for 1D convolutions that take between 1
      and 10 milliseconds with ``method='direct'``. A good proxy for this
      (at least in our experiments) is ``1e6 <= in1.size * in2.size <= 1e7``.

    The 2D results almost certainly generalize to 3D/4D/etc because the
    implementation is the same (the 1D implementation is different).

    All the numbers above are specific to the EC2 machine. However, we did find
    that this function generalizes fairly decently across hardware. The speed
    tests were of similar quality (and even slightly better) than the same
    tests performed on the machine to tune this function's numbers (a mid-2014
    15-inch MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM and a 2.5GHz Intel i7 processor).

    There are cases when `fftconvolve` supports the inputs but this function
    returns `direct` (e.g., to protect against floating point integer
    precision).

    .. versionadded:: 0.19

    Examples
    --------
    Estimate the fastest method for a given input:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> img = rng.random((32, 32))
    >>> filter = rng.random((8, 8))
    >>> method = signal.choose_conv_method(img, filter, mode='same')
    >>> method
    'fft'

    This can then be applied to other arrays of the same dtype and shape:

    >>> img2 = rng.random((32, 32))
    >>> filter2 = rng.random((8, 8))
    >>> corr2 = signal.correlate(img2, filter2, mode='same', method=method)
    >>> conv2 = signal.convolve(img2, filter2, mode='same', method=method)

    The output of this function (``method``) works with `correlate` and
    `convolve`.

    Warns
    -----
    RuntimeWarning
        Use of the FFT convolution on input containing NAN or INF will lead
        to the entire output being NAN or INF. Use method='direct' when your

    Notes
    -----
    By default, `convolve` and `correlate` use ``method='auto'``, which calls
    `choose_conv_method` to choose the fastest method using pre-computed
    values (`choose_conv_method` can also measure real-world timing with a
    keyword argument). Because `fftconvolve` relies on floating point numbers,
    there are certain constraints that may force ``method='direct'`` (more detail
    in `choose_conv_method` docstring).

    """
    Perform an order filter on an N-D array.

    Perform an order filter on the array in. The domain argument acts as a
    mask centered over each pixel. The non-zero elements of domain are
    used to select elements surrounding each input pixel which are placed
    in a list. The list is sorted, and the output for that pixel is the
    element corresponding to rank in the sorted list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The N-dimensional input array.
    domain : array_like
        A mask array with the same number of dimensions as `a`.
        Each dimension should have an odd number of elements.
    rank : int
        A non-negative integer which selects the element from the
        sorted list (0 corresponds to the smallest element, 1 is the
        next smallest element, etc.).

    Returns

    Notes

    The more general function `scipy.ndimage.median_filter` has a more
    efficient implementation of a median filter and therefore runs much faster.

    For 2-dimensional images with ``uint8``, ``float32`` or ``float64`` dtypes,
    the specialised function `scipy.signal.medfilt2d` may be faster.

    """
    Filter data along one-dimension with an IIR or FIR filter.

    Filter a data sequence, `x`, using a digital filter.  This works for many
    fundamental data types (including Object type).  The filter is a direct
    form II transposed implementation of the standard difference equation
    (see Notes).

    The function `sosfilt` (and filter design using ``output='sos'``) should be
    preferred over `lfilter` for most filtering tasks, as second-order sections
    have fewer numerical problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : array_like
        The numerator coefficient vector in a 1-D sequence.
    a : array_like
        The denominator coefficient vector in a 1-D sequence.  If ``a[0]``
        is not 1, then both `a` and `b` are normalized by ``a[0]``.
    x : array_like
        An N-dimensional input array.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of the input data array along which to apply the
        linear filter. The filter is applied to each subarray along
        this axis.  Default is -1.
    zi : array_like, optional
        Initial conditions for the filter delays.  It is a vector
        (or array of vectors for an N-dimensional input) of length
        ``max(len(a), len(b)) - 1``.  If `zi` is None or is not given then
        initial rest is assumed.  See `lfiltic` for more information.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array
        The output of the digital filter.
    zf : array, optional
        If `zi` is None, this is not returned, otherwise, `zf` holds the
        final filter delay values.

    See Also
    --------
    lfiltic : Construct initial conditions for `lfilter`.
    lfilter_zi : Compute initial state (steady state of step response) for
                 `lfilter`.
    filtfilt : A forward-backward filter, to obtain a filter with zero phase.
    savgol_filter : A Savitzky-Golay filter.
    sosfilt: Filter data using cascaded second-order sections.
    sosfiltfilt: A forward-backward filter using second-order sections.

    Notes
    -----
    The filter function is implemented as a direct II transposed structure.
    This means that the filter implements::

       a[0]*y[n] = b[0]*x[n] + b[1]*x[n-1] + ... + b[M]*x[n-M]
                             - a[1]*y[n-1] - ... - a[N]*y[n-N]

    where `M` is the degree of the numerator, `N` is the degree of the
    denominator, and `n` is the sample number.  It is implemented using
    the following difference equations (assuming M = N)::

         a[0]*y[n] = b[0] * x[n]               + d[0][n-1]
           d[0][n] = b[1] * x[n] - a[1] * y[n] + d[1][n-1]
           d[1][n] = b[2] * x[n] - a[2] * y[n] + d[2][n-1]
         ...
         d[N-2][n] = b[N-1]*x[n] - a[N-1]*y[n] + d[N-1][n-1]
         d[N-1][n] = b[N] * x[n] - a[N] * y[n]

    where `d` are the state variables.

    The rational transfer function describing this filter in the
    z-transform domain is::

                             -1              -M
                 b[0] + b[1]z  + ... + b[M] z
         Y(z) = -------------------------------- X(z)
                             -1              -N
                 a[0] + a[1]z  + ... + a[N] z

    --------

    ...      0.18*np.cos(2*np.pi*3.85*t))
    >>> xn = x + rng.standard_normal(len(t)) * 0.08

    Create an order 3 lowpass butterworth filter:

    >>> b, a = signal.butter(3, 0.05)

    Apply the filter to xn.  Use lfilter_zi to choose the initial condition of
    the filter:

    >>> zi = signal.lfilter_zi(b, a)
    >>> z, _ = signal.lfilter(b, a, xn, zi=zi*xn[0])

    Apply the filter again, to have a result filtered at an order the same as
    filtfilt:

    >>> z2, _ = signal.lfilter(b, a, z, zi=zi*z[0])

    Use filtfilt to apply the filter:

def hilbert(x, N=..., axis=...): # -> tuple[Dispatchable]:
    r"""FFT-based computation of the analytic signal.

    The analytic signal is calculated by filtering out the negative frequencies and
    doubling the amplitudes of the positive frequencies in the FFT domain.
    The imaginary part of the result is the hilbert transform of the real-valued input
    signal.
    
    The transformation is done along the last axis by default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Signal data.  Must be real.
    N : int, optional
        Number of Fourier components.  Default: ``x.shape[axis]``
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to do the transformation.  Default: -1.

    Returns
    -------
    xa : ndarray
        Analytic signal of `x`, of each 1-D array along `axis`

    Notes
    -----
    The analytic signal ``x_a(t)`` of a real-valued signal ``x(t)``
    can be expressed as [1]_

    .. math:: x_a = F^{-1}(F(x) 2U) = x + i y\ ,

    where `F` is the Fourier transform, `U` the unit step function,
    and `y` the Hilbert transform of `x`. [2]_

    In other words, the negative half of the frequency spectrum is zeroed
    out, turning the real-valued signal into a complex-valued signal.  The Hilbert
    transformed signal can be obtained from ``np.imag(hilbert(x))``, and the
    original signal from ``np.real(hilbert(x))``.

    envelope: Compute envelope of a real- or complex-valued signal.

    Examples
    --------
    In this example we use the Hilbert transform to determine the amplitude
    envelope and instantaneous frequency of an amplitude-modulated signal.

    Let's create a chirp of which the frequency increases from 20 Hz to 100 Hz and
    apply an amplitude modulation:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from scipy.signal import hilbert, chirp
    ...
    >>> duration, fs = 1, 400  # 1 s signal with sampling frequency of 400 Hz
    >>> t = np.arange(int(fs*duration)) / fs  # timestamps of samples
    >>> signal = chirp(t, 20.0, t[-1], 100.0)
    >>> signal *= (1.0 + 0.5 * np.sin(2.0*np.pi*3.0*t) )

    The amplitude envelope is given by the magnitude of the analytic signal. The
    instantaneous frequency can be obtained by differentiating the
    instantaneous phase in respect to time. The instantaneous phase corresponds
    to the phase angle of the analytic signal.

    >>> analytic_signal = hilbert(signal)
    >>> amplitude_envelope = np.abs(analytic_signal)
    >>> instantaneous_phase = np.unwrap(np.angle(analytic_signal))
    >>> instantaneous_frequency = np.diff(instantaneous_phase) / (2.0*np.pi) * fs
    ...
    >>> fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharex='all', tight_layout=True)
    >>> ax0.set_title("Amplitude-modulated Chirp Signal")
    >>> ax0.set_ylabel("Amplitude")
    >>> ax0.plot(t, signal, label='Signal')
    >>> ax0.plot(t, amplitude_envelope, label='Envelope')

    r"""Compute the envelope of a real- or complex-valued signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : ndarray
        Real- or complex-valued input signal, which is assumed to be made up of ``n``
        samples and having sampling interval ``T``. `z` may also be a multidimensional
        array with the time axis being defined by `axis`.
    bp_in : tuple[int | None, int | None], optional
        2-tuple defining the frequency band ``bp_in[0]:bp_in[1]`` of the input filter.
        The corner frequencies are specified as integer multiples of ``1/(n*T)`` with
        ``-n//2 <= bp_in[0] < bp_in[1] <= (n+1)//2`` being the allowed frequency range.
        ``None`` entries are replaced with ``-n//2`` or ``(n+1)//2`` respectively. The
        default of ``(1, None)`` removes the mean value as well as the negative
        frequency components.
    n_out : int | None, optional
        If not ``None`` the output will be resampled to `n_out` samples. The default
        of ``None`` sets the output to the same length as the input `z`.
    squared : bool, optional
        If set, the square of the envelope is returned. The bandwidth of the squared
        envelope is often smaller than the non-squared envelope bandwidth due to the
        nonlinear nature of the utilized absolute value function. I.e., the embedded
        square root function typically produces addiational harmonics.
        The default is ``False``.
    residual : Literal['lowpass', 'all', None], optional
        This option determines what kind of residual, i.e., the signal part which the
        input bandpass filter removes, is returned. ``'all'`` returns everything except
        the contents of the frequency band ``bp_in[0]:bp_in[1]``, ``'lowpass'``
        returns the contents of the frequency band ``< bp_in[0]``. If ``None`` then
        only the envelope is returned. Default: ``'lowpass'``.
    axis : int, optional
       Axis of `z` over which to compute the envelope. Default is last the axis.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        If parameter `residual` is ``None`` then an array ``z_env`` with the same shape
        as the input `z` is returned, containing its envelope. Otherwise, an array with
        shape ``(2, *z.shape)``, containing the arrays ``z_env`` and ``z_res``, stacked
        along the first axis, is returned.
        It allows unpacking, i.e., ``z_env, z_res = envelope(z, residual='all')``.
        The residual ``z_res`` contains the signal part which the input bandpass filter
        removed, depending on the parameter `residual`. Note that for real-valued
        signals, a real-valued residual is returned. Hence, the negative frequency
        components of `bp_in` are ignored.

    Notes
    -----
    Any complex-valued signal :math:`z(t)` can be described by a real-valued
    instantaneous amplitude :math:`a(t)` and a real-valued instantaneous phase
    :math:`\phi(t)`, i.e., :math:`z(t) = a(t) \exp\!\big(j \phi(t)\big)`. The
    envelope is defined as the absolute value of the amplitude :math:`|a(t)| = |z(t)|`,
    which is at the same time the absolute value of the signal. Hence, :math:`|a(t)|`
    "envelopes" the class of all signals with amplitude :math:`a(t)` and arbitrary
    phase :math:`\phi(t)`.
    For real-valued signals, :math:`x(t) = a(t) \cos\!\big(\phi(t)\big)` is the
    analogous formulation. Hence, :math:`|a(t)|` can be determined by converting
    :math:`x(t)` into an analytic signal :math:`z_a(t)` by means of a Hilbert
    transform, i.e.,
    :math:`z_a(t) = a(t) \cos\!\big(\phi(t)\big) + j a(t) \sin\!\big(\phi(t) \big)`,
    which produces a complex-valued signal with the same envelope :math:`|a(t)|`.

    The implementation is based on computing the FFT of the input signal and then
    performing the necessary operations in Fourier space. Hence, the typical FFT
    caveats need to be taken into account:

    * The signal is assumed to be periodic. Discontinuities between signal start and
      end can lead to unwanted results due to Gibbs phenomenon.
    * The FFT is slow if the signal length is prime or very long. Also, the memory
      demands are typically higher than a comparable FIR/IIR filter based
      implementation.
    * The frequency spacing ``1 / (n*T)`` for corner frequencies of the bandpass filter
      corresponds to the frequencies produced by ``scipy.fft.fftfreq(len(z), T)``.

    If the envelope of a complex-valued signal `z` with no bandpass filtering is
    desired, i.e., ``bp_in=(None, None)``, then the envelope corresponds to the
    absolute value. Hence, it is more efficient to use ``np.abs(z)`` instead of this
    function.

    Although computing the envelope based on the analytic signal [1]_ is the natural
    method for real-valued signals, other methods are also frequently used. The most
    popular alternative is probably the so-called "square-law" envelope detector and
    its relatives [2]_. They do not always compute the correct result for all kinds of
    signals, but are usually correct and typically computationally more efficient for
    most kinds of narrowband signals. The definition for an envelope presented here is
    common where instantaneous amplitude and phase are of interest (e.g., as described
    in [3]_). There exist also other concepts, which rely on the general mathematical
    idea of an envelope [4]_: A pragmatic approach is to determine all upper and lower
    signal peaks and use a spline interpolation to determine the curves [5]_.

    Examples
    --------
    The following plot illustrates the envelope of a signal with variable frequency and
    a low-frequency drift. To separate the drift from the envelope, a 4 Hz highpass
    filter is used. The low-pass residuum of the input bandpass filter is utilized to
    determine an asymmetric upper and lower bound to enclose the signal. Due to the
    smoothness of the resulting envelope, it is down-sampled from 500 to 40 samples.
    Note that the instantaneous amplitude ``a_x`` and the computed envelope ``x_env``
    are not perfectly identical. This is due to the signal not being perfectly periodic
    as well as the existence of some spectral overlapping of ``x_carrier`` and
    ``x_drift``. Hence, they cannot be completely separated by a bandpass filter.

    The second example provides a geometric envelope interpretation of complex-valued
    signals: The following two plots show the complex-valued signal as a blue
    3d-trajectory and the envelope as an orange round tube with varying diameter, i.e.,
    as :math:`|a(t)| \exp(j\rho(t))`, with :math:`\rho(t)\in[-\pi,\pi]`. Also, the
    projection into the 2d real and imaginary coordinate planes of trajectory and tube
    is depicted. Every point of the complex-valued signal touches the tube's surface.

    The left plot shows an analytic signal, i.e, the phase difference between
    imaginary and real part is always 90 degrees, resulting in a spiraling trajectory.
    It can be seen that in this case the real part has also the expected envelope,
    i.e., representing the absolute value of the instantaneous amplitude.

    The right plot shows the real part of that analytic signal being interpreted
    as a complex-vauled signal, i.e., having zero imaginary part. There the resulting
    envelope is not as smooth as in the analytic case and the instantaneous amplitude
    in the real plane is not recovered. If ``z_re`` had been passed as a real-valued
    signal, i.e., as ``z_re = z.real`` instead of ``z_re = z.real + 0j``, the result
    would have been identical to the left plot. The reason for this is that real-valued
    signals are interpreted as being the real part of a complex-valued analytic signal.

    -----
    The "deflation through subtraction" algorithm is used for

    The form of partial fraction expansion depends on poles multiplicity in
    the exact mathematical sense. However there is no way to exactly
    determine multiplicity of roots of a polynomial in numerical computing.
    Thus you should think of the result of `residue` with given `tol` as
    partial fraction expansion computed for the denominator composed of the
    computed poles with empirically determined multiplicity. The choice of
    `tol` can drastically change the result if there are close poles.

    The resampled signal starts at the same value as `x` but is sampled
    with a spacing of ``len(x) / num * (spacing of x)``.  Because a
    Fourier method is used, the signal is assumed to be periodic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be resampled.
    num : int
        The number of samples in the resampled signal.
    t : array_like, optional
        If `t` is given, it is assumed to be the equally spaced sample
        positions associated with the signal data in `x`.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` that is resampled.  Default is 0.
    window : array_like, callable, string, float, or tuple, optional
        Specifies the window applied to the signal in the Fourier
        domain.  See below for details.
    domain : string, optional
        A string indicating the domain of the input `x`:
        ``time`` Consider the input `x` as time-domain (Default),
        ``freq`` Consider the input `x` as frequency-domain.

    Returns
    -------
    resampled_x or (resampled_x, resampled_t)
        Either the resampled array, or, if `t` was given, a tuple
        containing the resampled array and the corresponding resampled
        positions.

    See Also
    --------
    decimate : Downsample the signal after applying an FIR or IIR filter.
    resample_poly : Resample using polyphase filtering and an FIR filter.

    Notes
    -----
    The argument `window` controls a Fourier-domain window that tapers
    the Fourier spectrum before zero-padding to alleviate ringing in
    the resampled values for sampled signals you didn't intend to be
    interpreted as band-limited.

    If `window` is a function, then it is called with a vector of inputs
    indicating the frequency bins (i.e. fftfreq(x.shape[axis]) ).

    If `window` is an array of the same length as `x.shape[axis]` it is
    assumed to be the window to be applied directly in the Fourier
    domain (with dc and low-frequency first).

    For any other type of `window`, the function `scipy.signal.get_window`
    is called to generate the window.

    The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
    sample of the input vector.  The spacing between samples is changed
    from ``dx`` to ``dx * len(x) / num``.

    If `t` is not None, then it is used solely to calculate the resampled
    positions `resampled_t`

    As noted, `resample` uses FFT transformations, which can be very 
    slow if the number of input or output samples is large and prime; 
    see :func:`~scipy.fft.fft`. In such cases, it can be faster to first downsample 
    a signal of length ``n`` with :func:`~scipy.signal.resample_poly` by a factor of 
    ``n//num`` before using `resample`. Note that this approach changes the 
    characteristics of the antialiasing filter.

    Examples
    --------
    Note that the end of the resampled data rises to meet the first
    sample of the next cycle:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 20, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = np.cos(-x**2/6.0)
    >>> f = signal.resample(y, 100)
    >>> xnew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100, endpoint=False)

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'go-', xnew, f, '.-', 10, y[0], 'ro')
    >>> plt.legend(['data', 'resampled'], loc='best')
    >>> plt.show()

    Consider the following signal  ``y`` where ``len(y)`` is a large  prime number:

    >>> N = 55949
    >>> freq = 100
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
    >>> y = np.cos(2 * np.pi * freq * x)

    Due to ``N`` being prime,

    >>> num = 5000
    >>> f = signal.resample(signal.resample_poly(y, 1, N // num), num)

    runs significantly faster than

    >>> f = signal.resample(y, num)
    """
    ...

def resample_poly(x, up, down, axis=..., window=..., padtype=..., cval=...): # -> NDArray[Any]:
    """
    Resample `x` along the given axis using polyphase filtering.

    The signal `x` is upsampled by the factor `up`, a zero-phase low-pass
    FIR filter is applied, and then it is downsampled by the factor `down`.
    The resulting sample rate is ``up / down`` times the original sample
    rate. By default, values beyond the boundary of the signal are assumed
    to be zero during the filtering step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be resampled.
    up : int
        The upsampling factor.
    down : int
        The downsampling factor.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` that is resampled. Default is 0.
    window : string, tuple, or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use to design the low-pass filter, or the FIR filter
        coefficients to employ. See below for details.
    padtype : string, optional
        `constant`, `line`, `mean`, `median`, `maximum`, `minimum` or any of
        the other signal extension modes supported by `scipy.signal.upfirdn`.
        Changes assumptions on values beyond the boundary. If `constant`,
        assumed to be `cval` (default zero). If `line` assumed to continue a
        linear trend defined by the first and last points. `mean`, `median`,
        `maximum` and `minimum` work as in `np.pad` and assume that the values
        beyond the boundary are the mean, median, maximum or minimum
        respectively of the array along the axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4.0
    cval : float, optional
        Value to use if `padtype='constant'`. Default is zero.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Returns
    -------
    resampled_x : array
        The resampled array.

    See Also
    --------
    decimate : Downsample the signal after applying an FIR or IIR filter.
    resample : Resample up or down using the FFT method.

    Notes
    -----
    This polyphase method will likely be faster than the Fourier method
    in `scipy.signal.resample` when the number of samples is large and
    prime, or when the number of samples is large and `up` and `down`
    share a large greatest common denominator. The length of the FIR
    filter used will depend on ``max(up, down) // gcd(up, down)``, and
    the number of operations during polyphase filtering will depend on
    the filter length and `down` (see `scipy.signal.upfirdn` for details).

    The argument `window` specifies the FIR low-pass filter design.

    If `window` is an array_like it is assumed to be the FIR filter
    coefficients. Note that the FIR filter is applied after the upsampling
    step, so it should be designed to operate on a signal at a sampling
    frequency higher than the original by a factor of `up//gcd(up, down)`.
    This function's output will be centered with respect to this array, so it
    is best to pass a symmetric filter with an odd number of samples if, as
    is usually the case, a zero-phase filter is desired.

    For any other type of `window`, the functions `scipy.signal.get_window`
    and `scipy.signal.firwin` are called to generate the appropriate filter
    coefficients.

    The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
    sample of the input vector. The spacing between samples is changed
    from ``dx`` to ``dx * down / float(up)``.

    Examples
    --------
    By default, the end of the resampled data rises to meet the first
    sample of the next cycle for the FFT method, and gets closer to zero
    for the polyphase method:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 20, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = np.cos(-x**2/6.0)
    >>> f_fft = signal.resample(y, 100)
    >>> f_poly = signal.resample_poly(y, 100, 20)
    >>> xnew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100, endpoint=False)

    >>> plt.plot(xnew, f_fft, 'b.-', xnew, f_poly, 'r.-')
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'ko-')
    >>> plt.plot(10, y[0], 'bo', 10, 0., 'ro')  # boundaries
    >>> plt.legend(['resample', 'resamp_poly', 'data'], loc='best')
    >>> plt.show()

    This default behaviour can be changed by using the padtype option:

    >>> N = 5
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = 2 + x**2 - 1.7*np.sin(x) + .2*np.cos(11*x)
    >>> y2 = 1 + x**3 + 0.1*np.sin(x) + .1*np.cos(11*x)
    >>> Y = np.stack([y, y2], axis=-1)
    >>> up = 4
    >>> xr = np.linspace(0, 1, N*up, endpoint=False)

    >>> y2 = signal.resample_poly(Y, up, 1, padtype='constant')
    >>> y3 = signal.resample_poly(Y, up, 1, padtype='mean')
    >>> y4 = signal.resample_poly(Y, up, 1, padtype='line')

def vectorstrength(events, period): # -> tuple[Any, Any]:

    Determine the vector strength of the events corresponding to the given

    The vector strength is a measure of phase synchrony, how well the
    timing of the events is synchronized to a single period of a periodic
    signal.

    If multiple periods are used, calculate the vector strength of each.
    This is called the "resonating vector strength".

    Parameters
    ----------
    events : 1D array_like
        An array of time points containing the timing of the events.
    period : float or array_like
        The period of the signal that the events should synchronize to.
        The period is in the same units as `events`.  It can also be an array
        of periods, in which case the outputs are arrays of the same length.

    Returns
    -------
    strength : float or 1D array
        The strength of the synchronization.  1.0 is perfect synchronization
        and 0.0 is no synchronization.  If `period` is an array, this is also
        an array with each element containing the vector strength at the
        corresponding period.
    phase : float or array
        The phase that the events are most strongly synchronized to in radians.
        If `period` is an array, this is also an array with each element
        containing the phase for the corresponding period.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        The input data.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to detrend the data. By default this is the
        last axis (-1).
    type : {'linear', 'constant'}, optional
        The type of detrending. If ``type == 'linear'`` (default),
        the result of a linear least-squares fit to `data` is subtracted
        from `data`.
        If ``type == 'constant'``, only the mean of `data` is subtracted.
    bp : array_like of ints, optional
        A sequence of break points. If given, an individual linear fit is
        performed for each part of `data` between two break points.
        Break points are specified as indices into `data`. This parameter
        only has an effect when ``type == 'linear'``.
    overwrite_data : bool, optional
        If True, perform in place detrending and avoid a copy. Default is False

    Returns
    -------
    ret : ndarray
        The detrended input data.

    Notes
    -----
    Detrending can be interpreted as subtracting a least squares fit polynomial:
    Setting the parameter `type` to 'constant' corresponds to fitting a zeroth degree
    polynomial, 'linear' to a first degree polynomial. Consult the example below.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit: Create least squares fit polynomial.


    Examples
    --------
    The following example detrends the function :math:`x(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1/4`:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.signal import detrend
    ...
    >>> t = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, 21)
    >>> x = np.sin(np.pi*t) + 1/4
    ...
    >>> x_d_const = detrend(x, type='constant')
    >>> x_d_linear = detrend(x, type='linear')
    ...
    >>> fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax1.set_title(r"Detrending $x(t)=\sin(\pi t) + 1/4$")
    >>> ax1.set(xlabel="t", ylabel="$x(t)$", xlim=(t[0], t[-1]))
    >>> ax1.axhline(y=0, color='black', linewidth=.5)
    >>> ax1.axvline(x=0, color='black', linewidth=.5)
    >>> ax1.plot(t, x, 'C0.-',  label="No detrending")
    >>> ax1.plot(t, x_d_const, 'C1x-', label="type='constant'")
    >>> ax1.plot(t, x_d_linear, 'C2+-', label="type='linear'")
    >>> ax1.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

    Alternatively, NumPy's `~numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial` can be used for
    detrending as well:

    >>> pp0 = np.polynomial.Polynomial.fit(t, x, deg=0)  # fit degree 0 polynomial
    >>> np.allclose(x_d_const, x - pp0(t))  # compare with constant detrend
    True
    >>> pp1 = np.polynomial.Polynomial.fit(t, x, deg=1)  # fit degree 1 polynomial
    >>> np.allclose(x_d_linear, x - pp1(t))  # compare with linear detrend
    True

    Note that `~numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial` also allows fitting higher
    degree polynomials. Consult its documentation on how to extract the polynomial
    coefficients.

def lfilter_zi(b, a):
    """
    Construct initial conditions for lfilter for step response steady-state.

    Compute an initial state `zi` for the `lfilter` function that corresponds
    to the steady state of the step response.

    A typical use of this function is to set the initial state so that the
    output of the filter starts at the same value as the first element of
    the signal to be filtered.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b, a : array_like (1-D)
        The IIR filter coefficients. See `lfilter` for more
        information.

    Returns
    -------
    zi : 1-D ndarray
        The initial state for the filter.

    See Also
    --------
    lfilter, lfiltic, filtfilt

    Notes
    -----
    A linear filter with order m has a state space representation (A, B, C, D),
    for which the output y of the filter can be expressed as::

        z(n+1) = A*z(n) + B*x(n)
        y(n)   = C*z(n) + D*x(n)

    where z(n) is a vector of length m, A has shape (m, m), B has shape
    (m, 1), C has shape (1, m) and D has shape (1, 1) (assuming x(n) is
    a scalar).  lfilter_zi solves::

        zi = A*zi + B

    In other words, it finds the initial condition for which the response
    to an input of all ones is a constant.

    Given the filter coefficients `a` and `b`, the state space matrices
    for the transposed direct form II implementation of the linear filter,
    which is the implementation used by scipy.signal.lfilter, are::

        A = scipy.linalg.companion(a).T
        B = b[1:] - a[1:]*b[0]

    assuming ``a[0]`` is 1.0; if ``a[0]`` is not 1, `a` and `b` are first
    divided by a[0].

    Examples
    --------
    The following code creates a lowpass Butterworth filter. Then it
    applies that filter to an array whose values are all 1.0; the
    output is also all 1.0, as expected for a lowpass filter.  If the
    `zi` argument of `lfilter` had not been given, the output would have
    shown the transient signal.

    >>> from numpy import array, ones
    >>> from scipy.signal import lfilter, lfilter_zi, butter
    >>> b, a = butter(5, 0.25)
    >>> zi = lfilter_zi(b, a)
    >>> y, zo = lfilter(b, a, ones(10), zi=zi)
    >>> y
    array([1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])

    Another example:

    >>> x = array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
    >>> y, zf = lfilter(b, a, x, zi=zi*x[0])

        0.44399389,  0.35505241])

    Note that the `zi` argument to `lfilter` was computed using
    `lfilter_zi` and scaled by ``x[0]``.  Then the output `y` has no
    transient until the input drops from 0.5 to 0.0.

def filtfilt(b, a, x, axis=..., padtype=..., padlen=..., method=..., irlen=...): # -> NDArray[Any] | Any:
    """
    Apply a digital filter forward and backward to a signal.

    This function applies a linear digital filter twice, once forward and
    once backwards.  The combined filter has zero phase and a filter order
    twice that of the original.

    The function provides options for handling the edges of the signal.

    The function `sosfiltfilt` (and filter design using ``output='sos'``)
    should be preferred over `filtfilt` for most filtering tasks, as
    second-order sections have fewer numerical problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : (N,) array_like
        The numerator coefficient vector of the filter.
    a : (N,) array_like
        The denominator coefficient vector of the filter.  If ``a[0]``
        is not 1, then both `a` and `b` are normalized by ``a[0]``.
    x : array_like
        The array of data to be filtered.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` to which the filter is applied.
        Default is -1.
    padtype : str or None, optional
        Must be 'odd', 'even', 'constant', or None.  This determines the
        type of extension to use for the padded signal to which the filter
        is applied.  If `padtype` is None, no padding is used.  The default
        is 'odd'.
    padlen : int or None, optional
        The number of elements by which to extend `x` at both ends of
        `axis` before applying the filter.  This value must be less than
        ``x.shape[axis] - 1``.  ``padlen=0`` implies no padding.
        The default value is ``3 * max(len(a), len(b))``.
    method : str, optional
        Determines the method for handling the edges of the signal, either
        "pad" or "gust".  When `method` is "pad", the signal is padded; the
        type of padding is determined by `padtype` and `padlen`, and `irlen`
        is ignored.  When `method` is "gust", Gustafsson's method is used,
        and `padtype` and `padlen` are ignored.
    irlen : int or None, optional
        When `method` is "gust", `irlen` specifies the length of the
        impulse response of the filter.  If `irlen` is None, no part
        of the impulse response is ignored.  For a long signal, specifying
        `irlen` can significantly improve the performance of the filter.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The filtered output with the same shape as `x`.

    See Also
    --------
    sosfiltfilt, lfilter_zi, lfilter, lfiltic, savgol_filter, sosfilt

    Notes
    -----
    When `method` is "pad", the function pads the data along the given axis
    in one of three ways: odd, even or constant.  The odd and even extensions
    have the corresponding symmetry about the end point of the data.  The
    constant extension extends the data with the values at the end points. On
    both the forward and backward passes, the initial condition of the
    filter is found by using `lfilter_zi` and scaling it by the end point of
    the extended data.

    When `method` is "gust", Gustafsson's method [1]_ is used.  Initial
    conditions are chosen for the forward and backward passes so that the
    forward-backward filter gives the same result as the backward-forward
    filter.

    The option to use Gustaffson's method was added in scipy version 0.16.0.

    .. [1] F. Gustaffson, "Determining the initial states in forward-backward
           filtering", Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 46, pp. 988-992,
           1996.

    Examples
    --------
    The examples will use several functions from `scipy.signal`.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    First we create a one second signal that is the sum of two pure sine
    waves, with frequencies 5 Hz and 250 Hz, sampled at 2000 Hz.

    >>> t = np.linspace(0, 1.0, 2001)
    >>> xlow = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * t)
    >>> xhigh = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 250 * t)
    >>> x = xlow + xhigh

    Now create a lowpass Butterworth filter with a cutoff of 0.125 times
    the Nyquist frequency, or 125 Hz, and apply it to ``x`` with `filtfilt`.
    The result should be approximately ``xlow``, with no phase shift.

    >>> b, a = signal.butter(8, 0.125)
    >>> y = signal.filtfilt(b, a, x, padlen=150)
    >>> np.abs(y - xlow).max()
    9.1086182074789912e-06

    We get a fairly clean result for this artificial example because
    the odd extension is exact, and with the moderately long padding,
    the filter's transients have dissipated by the time the actual data
    is reached.  In general, transient effects at the edges are
    unavoidable.

    The following example demonstrates the option ``method="gust"``.

    First, create a filter.

    >>> b, a = signal.ellip(4, 0.01, 120, 0.125)  # Filter to be applied.

    `sig` is a random input signal to be filtered.

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> n = 60
    >>> sig = rng.standard_normal(n)**3 + 3*rng.standard_normal(n).cumsum()

    Apply `filtfilt` to `sig`, once using the Gustafsson method, and
    once using padding, and plot the results for comparison.

    >>> fgust = signal.filtfilt(b, a, sig, method="gust")
    >>> fpad = signal.filtfilt(b, a, sig, padlen=50)
    >>> plt.plot(sig, 'k-', label='input')
    >>> plt.plot(fgust, 'b-', linewidth=4, label='gust')
    >>> plt.plot(fpad, 'c-', linewidth=1.5, label='pad')
    >>> plt.legend(loc='best')
    >>> plt.show()

    The `irlen` argument can be used to improve the performance
    of Gustafsson's method.

    Estimate the impulse response length of the filter.

    >>> z, p, k = signal.tf2zpk(b, a)
    >>> eps = 1e-9
    >>> r = np.max(np.abs(p))
    >>> approx_impulse_len = int(np.ceil(np.log(eps) / np.log(r)))
    >>> approx_impulse_len
    137

    Apply the filter to a longer signal, with and without the `irlen`
    argument.  The difference between `y1` and `y2` is small.  For long
    signals, using `irlen` gives a significant performance improvement.

    >>> x = rng.standard_normal(4000)
    >>> y1 = signal.filtfilt(b, a, x, method='gust')
    >>> y2 = signal.filtfilt(b, a, x, method='gust', irlen=approx_impulse_len)
    >>> print(np.max(np.abs(y1 - y2)))

    Parameters
    ----------
    sos : array_like
        Array of second-order filter coefficients, must have shape

    x : array_like
        An N-dimensional input array.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of the input data array along which to apply the
        linear filter. The filter is applied to each subarray along
        this axis.  Default is -1.
    zi : array_like, optional
        Initial conditions for the cascaded filter delays.  It is a (at
        least 2D) vector of shape ``(n_sections, ..., 2, ...)``, where
        ``..., 2, ...`` denotes the shape of `x`, but with ``x.shape[axis]``
        replaced by 2.  If `zi` is None or is not given then initial rest
        (i.e. all zeros) is assumed.
        Note that these initial conditions are *not* the same as the initial
        conditions given by `lfiltic` or `lfilter_zi`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The output of the digital filter.
    zf : ndarray, optional
        If `zi` is None, this is not returned, otherwise, `zf` holds the
        final filter delay values.

    axis : int, optional
        The axis of `x` to which the filter is applied.
        Default is -1.
    padtype : str or None, optional
        Must be 'odd', 'even', 'constant', or None.  This determines the
        type of extension to use for the padded signal to which the filter
        is applied.  If `padtype` is None, no padding is used.  The default
        is 'odd'.
    padlen : int or None, optional

        `axis` before applying the filter.  This value must be less than
        ``x.shape[axis] - 1``.  ``padlen=0`` implies no padding.
        The default value is::

            3 * (2 * len(sos) + 1 - min((sos[:, 2] == 0).sum(),
                                        (sos[:, 5] == 0).sum()))

        The extra subtraction at the end attempts to compensate for poles
        and zeros at the origin (e.g. for odd-order filters) to yield
        equivalent estimates of `padlen` to those of `filtfilt` for

        .. versionadded:: 0.18.0

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The down-sampled signal.

    See Also
    --------
    resample : Resample up or down using the FFT method.
    resample_poly : Resample using polyphase filtering and an FIR filter.

    Notes
    -----
    The ``zero_phase`` keyword was added in 0.18.0.
    The possibility to use instances of ``dlti`` as ``ftype`` was added in
    0.18.0.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    Define wave parameters.

    >>> wave_duration = 3
    >>> sample_rate = 100
    >>> freq = 2
    >>> q = 5

    Calculate number of samples.

    >>> samples = wave_duration*sample_rate
    >>> samples_decimated = int(samples/q)

    Create cosine wave.

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, wave_duration, samples, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = np.cos(x*np.pi*freq*2)

    Decimate cosine wave.

    >>> ydem = signal.decimate(y, q)
    >>> xnew = np.linspace(0, wave_duration, samples_decimated, endpoint=False)

    Plot original and decimated waves.

    >>> plt.plot(x, y, '.-', xnew, ydem, 'o-')
    >>> plt.xlabel('Time, Seconds')
    >>> plt.legend(['data', 'decimated'], loc='best')
    >>> plt.show()
