    - ``signal.get_window(beta, numtaps)``
    - ``signal.get_window(('kaiser', beta), numtaps)``

    The empirical equations discovered by Kaiser are used.

    Examples
    --------
    We will use the Kaiser window method to design a lowpass FIR filter
    for a signal that is sampled at 1000 Hz.

    We want at least 65 dB rejection in the stop band, and in the pass
    band the gain should vary no more than 0.5%.

    We want a cutoff frequency of 175 Hz, with a transition between the
    pass band and the stop band of 24 Hz. That is, in the band [0, 163],
    the gain varies no more than 0.5%, and in the band [187, 500], the
    signal is attenuated by at least 65 dB.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.signal import kaiserord, firwin, freqz
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fs = 1000.0
    >>> cutoff = 175
    >>> width = 24

    The Kaiser method accepts just a single parameter to control the pass
    band ripple and the stop band rejection, so we use the more restrictive
    of the two. In this case, the pass band ripple is 0.005, or 46.02 dB,
    so we will use 65 dB as the design parameter.

    Use `kaiserord` to determine the length of the filter and the
    parameter for the Kaiser window.

    >>> numtaps, beta = kaiserord(65, width/(0.5*fs))
    >>> numtaps
    167
    >>> beta
    6.20426

    Use `firwin` to create the FIR filter.

    >>> taps = firwin(numtaps, cutoff, window=('kaiser', beta),
    ...               scale=False, fs=fs)

    Compute the frequency response of the filter.  ``w`` is the array of
    frequencies, and ``h`` is the corresponding complex array of frequency
    responses.

    >>> w, h = freqz(taps, worN=8000)
    >>> w *= 0.5*fs/np.pi  # Convert w to Hz.

    Compute the deviation of the magnitude of the filter's response from
    that of the ideal lowpass filter. Values in the transition region are
    set to ``nan``, so they won't appear in the plot.

    >>> ideal = w < cutoff  # The "ideal" frequency response.
    >>> deviation = np.abs(np.abs(h) - ideal)
    >>> deviation[(w > cutoff - 0.5*width) & (w < cutoff + 0.5*width)] = np.nan

    Plot the deviation. A close look at the left end of the stop band shows
    that the requirement for 65 dB attenuation is violated in the first lobe
    by about 0.125 dB. This is not unusual for the Kaiser window method.

    >>> plt.plot(w, 20*np.log10(np.abs(deviation)))

def firwin(numtaps, cutoff, *, width=..., window=..., pass_zero=..., scale=..., fs=...): # -> NDArray[floating[Any]] | Any:
    """
    FIR filter design using the window method.

    This function computes the coefficients of a finite impulse response
    filter. The filter will have linear phase; it will be Type I if
    `numtaps` is odd and Type II if `numtaps` is even.

    Type II filters always have zero response at the Nyquist frequency, so a
    ValueError exception is raised if firwin is called with `numtaps` even and
    having a passband whose right end is at the Nyquist frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        Length of the filter (number of coefficients, i.e. the filter
        order + 1).  `numtaps` must be odd if a passband includes the
        Nyquist frequency.
    cutoff : float or 1-D array_like
        Cutoff frequency of filter (expressed in the same units as `fs`)
        OR an array of cutoff frequencies (that is, band edges). In the 
        former case, as a float, the cutoff frequency should correspond 
        with the half-amplitude point, where the attenuation will be -6dB. 
        In the latter case, the frequencies in `cutoff` should be positive 
        and monotonically increasing between 0 and `fs/2`. The values 0 
        and `fs/2` must not be included in `cutoff`. It should be noted 
        that this is different than the behavior of `scipy.signal.iirdesign`, 
        where the cutoff is the half-power point (-3dB).
    width : float or None, optional
        If `width` is not None, then assume it is the approximate width
        of the transition region (expressed in the same units as `fs`)
        for use in Kaiser FIR filter design. In this case, the `window`
        argument is ignored.
    window : string or tuple of string and parameter values, optional
        Desired window to use. See `scipy.signal.get_window` for a list
        of windows and required parameters.
    pass_zero : {True, False, 'bandpass', 'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
        If True, the gain at the frequency 0 (i.e., the "DC gain") is 1.
        If False, the DC gain is 0. Can also be a string argument for the
        desired filter type (equivalent to ``btype`` in IIR design functions).

        .. versionadded:: 1.3.0
           Support for string arguments.
    scale : bool, optional
        Set to True to scale the coefficients so that the frequency
        response is exactly unity at a certain frequency.
        That frequency is either:

        - 0 (DC) if the first passband starts at 0 (i.e. pass_zero
          is True)
        - `fs/2` (the Nyquist frequency) if the first passband ends at
          `fs/2` (i.e the filter is a single band highpass filter);
          center of first passband otherwise

    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal. Each frequency in `cutoff`
        must be between 0 and ``fs/2``.  Default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    h : (numtaps,) ndarray
        Coefficients of length `numtaps` FIR filter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any value in `cutoff` is less than or equal to 0 or greater
        than or equal to ``fs/2``, if the values in `cutoff` are not strictly
        monotonically increasing, or if `numtaps` is even but a passband
        includes the Nyquist frequency.

    FIR filter design using the window method.

    From the given frequencies `freq` and corresponding gains `gain`,
    this function constructs an FIR filter with linear phase and
    (approximately) the given frequency response.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        The number of taps in the FIR filter.  `numtaps` must be less than
        `nfreqs`.
    freq : array_like, 1-D
        The frequency sampling points. Typically 0.0 to 1.0 with 1.0 being
        Nyquist.  The Nyquist frequency is half `fs`.
        The values in `freq` must be nondecreasing. A value can be repeated
        once to implement a discontinuity. The first value in `freq` must
        be 0, and the last value must be ``fs/2``. Values 0 and ``fs/2`` must
        not be repeated.
    gain : array_like
        The filter gains at the frequency sampling points. Certain
        constraints to gain values, depending on the filter type, are applied,
        see Notes for details.
    nfreqs : int, optional
        The size of the interpolation mesh used to construct the filter.
        For most efficient behavior, this should be a power of 2 plus 1
        (e.g, 129, 257, etc). The default is one more than the smallest
        power of 2 that is not less than `numtaps`. `nfreqs` must be greater
        than `numtaps`.
    window : string or (string, float) or float, or None, optional
        Window function to use. Default is "hamming". See
        `scipy.signal.get_window` for the complete list of possible values.
        If None, no window function is applied.
    antisymmetric : bool, optional
        Whether resulting impulse response is symmetric/antisymmetric.
        See Notes for more details.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal. Each frequency in `cutoff`
        must be between 0 and ``fs/2``. Default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    taps : ndarray
        The filter coefficients of the FIR filter, as a 1-D array of length
        `numtaps`.

    Notes
    -----
    From the given set of frequencies and gains, the desired response is
    constructed in the frequency domain. The inverse FFT is applied to the
    desired response to create the associated convolution kernel, and the
    first `numtaps` coefficients of this kernel, scaled by `window`, are
    returned.

    The FIR filter will have linear phase. The type of filter is determined by
    the value of 'numtaps` and `antisymmetric` flag.
    There are four possible combinations:

       - odd  `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is False, type I filter is produced
       - even `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is False, type II filter is produced
       - odd  `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is True, type III filter is produced
       - even `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is True, type IV filter is produced

    Magnitude response of all but type I filters are subjects to following
    constraints:

       - type II  -- zero at the Nyquist frequency
       - type III -- zero at zero and Nyquist frequencies
       - type IV  -- zero at zero frequency

    Examples
    --------
    In these examples, `remez` is used to design low-pass, high-pass,
    band-pass and band-stop filters.  The parameters that define each filter
    are the filter order, the band boundaries, the transition widths of the
    boundaries, the desired gains in each band, and the sampling frequency.

    We'll use a sample frequency of 22050 Hz in all the examples.  In each
    example, the desired gain in each band is either 0 (for a stop band)
    or 1 (for a pass band).

    `freqz` is used to compute the frequency response of each filter, and
    the utility function ``plot_response`` defined below is used to plot
    the response.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> fs = 22050   # Sample rate, Hz

    >>> def plot_response(w, h, title):
    ...     "Utility function to plot response functions"
    ...     fig = plt.figure()
    ...     ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    ...     ax.plot(w, 20*np.log10(np.abs(h)))
    ...     ax.set_ylim(-40, 5)
    ...     ax.grid(True)
    ...     ax.set_xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
    ...     ax.set_ylabel('Gain (dB)')
    ...     ax.set_title(title)

    The first example is a low-pass filter, with cutoff frequency 8 kHz.
    The filter length is 325, and the transition width from pass to stop
    is 100 Hz.

    >>> cutoff = 8000.0    # Desired cutoff frequency, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 100  # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 325      # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, [0, cutoff, cutoff + trans_width, 0.5*fs],
    ...                     [1, 0], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "Low-pass Filter")
    >>> plt.show()

    This example shows a high-pass filter:

    >>> cutoff = 2000.0    # Desired cutoff frequency, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 250  # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 125      # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, [0, cutoff - trans_width, cutoff, 0.5*fs],
    ...                     [0, 1], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "High-pass Filter")
    >>> plt.show()

    This example shows a band-pass filter with a pass-band from 2 kHz to
    5 kHz.  The transition width is 260 Hz and the length of the filter
    is 63, which is smaller than in the other examples:

    >>> band = [2000, 5000]  # Desired pass band, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 260    # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 63         # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> edges = [0, band[0] - trans_width, band[0], band[1],
    ...          band[1] + trans_width, 0.5*fs]
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, edges, [0, 1, 0], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "Band-pass Filter")

    The low order leads to higher ripple and less steep transitions.

    The next example shows a band-stop filter.

    FIR filter design using least-squares error minimization.

    Calculate the filter coefficients for the linear-phase finite
    impulse response (FIR) filter which has the best approximation
    to the desired frequency response described by `bands` and
    `desired` in the least squares sense (i.e., the integral of the
    weighted mean-squared error within the specified bands is
    minimized).

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        The number of taps in the FIR filter. `numtaps` must be odd.
    bands : array_like
        A monotonic nondecreasing sequence containing the band edges in
        Hz. All elements must be non-negative and less than or equal to
        the Nyquist frequency given by `nyq`. The bands are specified as
        frequency pairs, thus, if using a 1D array, its length must be
        even, e.g., `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`. Alternatively, the
        bands can be specified as an nx2 sized 2D array, where n is the
        number of bands, e.g, `np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]])`.
    desired : array_like
        A sequence the same size as `bands` containing the desired gain
        at the start and end point of each band.
    weight : array_like, optional
        A relative weighting to give to each band region when solving
        the least squares problem. `weight` has to be half the size of
        `bands`.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal. Each frequency in `bands`
        must be between 0 and ``fs/2`` (inclusive). Default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    coeffs : ndarray
        Coefficients of the optimal (in a least squares sense) FIR filter.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation follows the algorithm given in [1]_.
    As noted there, least squares design has multiple advantages:

        1. Optimal in a least-squares sense.
        2. Simple, non-iterative method.
        3. The general solution can obtained by solving a linear
           system of equations.
        4. Allows the use of a frequency dependent weighting function.

    This function constructs a Type I linear phase FIR filter, which
    contains an odd number of `coeffs` satisfying for :math:`n < numtaps`:

    .. math:: coeffs(n) = coeffs(numtaps - 1 - n)

    The odd number of coefficients and filter symmetry avoid boundary
    conditions that could otherwise occur at the Nyquist and 0 frequencies
    (e.g., for Type II, III, or IV variants).

    Examples

    We want to construct a band-pass filter. Note that the behavior in the
    frequency ranges between our stop bands and pass bands is unspecified,
    and thus may overshoot depending on the parameters of our filter:

    """Convert a linear-phase FIR filter to minimum phase

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : array
        Linear-phase FIR filter coefficients.
    method : {'hilbert', 'homomorphic'}
        The provided methods are:

            'homomorphic' (default)
                This method [4]_ [5]_ works best with filters with an
                odd number of taps, and the resulting minimum phase filter
                will have a magnitude response that approximates the square
                root of the original filter's magnitude response using half
                the number of taps when ``half=True`` (default), or the
                original magnitude spectrum using the same number of taps
                when ``half=False``.

            'hilbert'
                This method [1]_ is designed to be used with equiripple
                filters (e.g., from `remez`) with unity or zero gain
                regions.

    n_fft : int
        The number of points to use for the FFT. Should be at least a
        few times larger than the signal length (see Notes).
    half : bool
        If ``True``, create a filter that is half the length of the original, with a
        magnitude spectrum that is the square root of the original. If ``False``,
        create a filter that is the same length as the original, with a magnitude
        spectrum that is designed to match the original (only supported when
        ``method='homomorphic'``).

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0

    Returns
    -------
    h_minimum : array
        The minimum-phase version of the filter, with length
        ``(len(h) + 1) // 2`` when ``half is True`` or ``len(h)`` otherwise.

    See Also
    --------
    firwin
    firwin2
    remez

    Notes
    -----
    Both the Hilbert [1]_ or homomorphic [4]_ [5]_ methods require selection
    of an FFT length to estimate the complex cepstrum of the filter.

    In the case of the Hilbert method, the deviation from the ideal
    spectrum ``epsilon`` is related to the number of stopband zeros
    ``n_stop`` and FFT length ``n_fft`` as::

        epsilon = 2. * n_stop / n_fft

    For example, with 100 stopband zeros and a FFT length of 2048,
    ``epsilon = 0.0976``. If we conservatively assume that the number of
    stopband zeros is one less than the filter length, we can take the FFT
    length to be the next power of 2 that satisfies ``epsilon=0.01`` as::

        n_fft = 2 ** int(np.ceil(np.log2(2 * (len(h) - 1) / 0.01)))

    This gives reasonable results for both the Hilbert and homomorphic
    methods, and gives the value used when ``n_fft=None``.

    Alternative implementations exist for creating minimum-phase filters,
    including zero inversion [2]_ and spectral factorization [3]_ [4]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Create an optimal linear-phase low-pass filter `h` with a transition band of
    [0.2, 0.3] (assuming a Nyquist frequency of 1):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.signal import remez, minimum_phase, freqz, group_delay
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> freq = [0, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0]
    >>> desired = [1, 0]
    >>> h_linear = remez(151, freq, desired, fs=2)

    Convert it to minimum phase:

    >>> h_hil = minimum_phase(h_linear, method='hilbert')
    >>> h_hom = minimum_phase(h_linear, method='homomorphic')
    >>> h_hom_full = minimum_phase(h_linear, method='homomorphic', half=False)

    Compare the impulse and frequency response of the four filters:

    >>> fig0, ax0 = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 3), tight_layout=True)
    >>> fig1, axs = plt.subplots(3, sharex='all', figsize=(6, 6), tight_layout=True)
    >>> ax0.set_title("Impulse response")
    >>> ax0.set(xlabel='Samples', ylabel='Amplitude', xlim=(0, len(h_linear) - 1))

    >>> axs[2].set(ylabel="Group Delay / samples", ylim=(-31, 81),
    ...             xlabel='Normalized Frequency (Nyqist frequency: 1)')
    >>> for h, lb in ((h_linear,   f'Linear ({len(h_linear)})'),
    ...               (h_hil,      f'Min-Hilbert ({len(h_hil)})'),
    ...               (h_hom,      f'Min-Homomorphic ({len(h_hom)})'),
    ...               (h_hom_full, f'Min-Homom. Full ({len(h_hom_full)})')):
    ...     w_H, H = freqz(h, fs=2)
    ...     w_gd, gd = group_delay((h, 1), fs=2)
    ...
    ...     alpha = 1.0 if lb == 'linear' else 0.5  # full opacity for 'linear' line
    ...     ax0.plot(h, '.-', alpha=alpha, label=lb)
    ...     axs[0].plot(w_H, 20 * np.log10(np.abs(H)), alpha=alpha)
    ...     axs[1].plot(w_H, np.unwrap(np.angle(H)), alpha=alpha, label=lb)
    ...     axs[2].plot(w_gd, gd, alpha=alpha)
    >>> ax0.grid(True)
    >>> ax0.legend(title='Filter Phase (Order)')
    >>> axs[1].legend(title='Filter Phase (Order)', loc='lower right')
    >>> for ax_ in axs:  # shade transition band:
    ...     ax_.axvspan(freq[1], freq[2], color='y', alpha=.25)
    ...     ax_.grid(True)
    >>> plt.show()

    The impulse response and group delay plot depict the 75 sample delay of the linear
    phase filter `h`. The phase should also be linear in the stop band--due to the small
    magnitude, numeric noise dominates there. Furthermore, the plots show that the
    minimum phase filters clearly show a reduced (negative) phase slope in the pass and
    transition band. The plots also illustrate that the filter with parameters
    ``method='homomorphic', half=False`` has same order and magnitude response as the
    linear filter `h` whereas the other minimum phase filters have only half the order
    and the square root  of the magnitude response.
