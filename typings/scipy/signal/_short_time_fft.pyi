    r"""Provide a parametrized discrete Short-time Fourier transform (stft)
    and its inverse (istft).

    .. currentmodule:: scipy.signal.ShortTimeFFT

    The `~ShortTimeFFT.stft` calculates sequential FFTs by sliding a
    window (`win`) over an input signal by `hop` increments. It can be used to
    quantify the change of the spectrum over time.

    The `~ShortTimeFFT.stft` is represented by a complex-valued matrix S[q,p]
    where the p-th column represents an FFT with the window centered at the
    time t[p] = p * `delta_t` = p * `hop` * `T` where `T` is  the sampling
    interval of the input signal. The q-th row represents the values at the
    frequency f[q] = q * `delta_f` with `delta_f` = 1 / (`mfft` * `T`) being
    the bin width of the FFT.

    The inverse STFT `~ShortTimeFFT.istft` is calculated by reversing the steps
    of the STFT: Take the IFFT of the p-th slice of S[q,p] and multiply the
    result with the so-called dual window (see `dual_win`). Shift the result by
    p * `delta_t` and add the result to previous shifted results to reconstruct
    the signal. If only the dual window is known and the STFT is invertible,
    `from_dual` can be used to instantiate this class.

    Due to the convention of time t = 0 being at the first sample of the input
    signal, the STFT values typically have negative time slots. Hence,
    negative indexes like `p_min` or `k_min` do not indicate counting
    backwards from an array's end like in standard Python indexing but being
    left of t = 0.

    More detailed information can be found in the :ref:`tutorial_stft` section
    of the :ref:`user_guide`.

    Note that all parameters of the initializer, except `scale_to` (which uses
    `scaling`) have identical named attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    win : np.ndarray
        The window must be a real- or complex-valued 1d array.
    hop : int
        The increment in samples, by which the window is shifted in each step.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of input signal and window. Its relation to the
        sampling interval `T` is ``T = 1 / fs``.
    fft_mode : 'twosided', 'centered', 'onesided', 'onesided2X'
        Mode of FFT to be used (default 'onesided').
        See property `fft_mode` for details.
    mfft: int | None
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired.
        If ``None`` (default), the length of the window `win` is used.
    dual_win : np.ndarray | None
        The dual window of `win`. If set to ``None``, it is calculated if
        needed.
    scale_to : 'magnitude', 'psd' | None
        If not ``None`` (default) the window function is scaled, so each STFT
        column represents  either a 'magnitude' or a power spectral density
        ('psd') spectrum. This parameter sets the property `scaling` to the
        same value. See method `scale_to` for details.
    phase_shift : int | None
        If set, add a linear phase `phase_shift` / `mfft` * `f` to each
        frequency `f`. The default value 0 ensures that there is no phase shift
        on the zeroth slice (in which t=0 is centered). See property
        `phase_shift` for more details.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows the magnitude of the STFT of a sine with
    varying frequency :math:`f_i(t)` (marked by a red dashed line in the plot):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from scipy.signal import ShortTimeFFT
    >>> from scipy.signal.windows import gaussian
    ...
    >>> T_x, N = 1 / 20, 1000  # 20 Hz sampling rate for 50 s signal
    >>> t_x = np.arange(N) * T_x  # time indexes for signal
    >>> f_i = 1 * np.arctan((t_x - t_x[N // 2]) / 2) + 5  # varying frequency
    >>> x = np.sin(2*np.pi*np.cumsum(f_i)*T_x) # the signal

    The utilized Gaussian window is 50 samples or 2.5 s long. The parameter
    ``mfft=200`` in `ShortTimeFFT` causes the spectrum to be oversampled
    by a factor of 4:

    >>> g_std = 8  # standard deviation for Gaussian window in samples
    >>> w = gaussian(50, std=g_std, sym=True)  # symmetric Gaussian window
    >>> SFT = ShortTimeFFT(w, hop=10, fs=1/T_x, mfft=200, scale_to='magnitude')
    >>> Sx = SFT.stft(x)  # perform the STFT

    In the plot, the time extent of the signal `x` is marked by vertical dashed
    lines. Note that the SFT produces values outside the time range of `x`. The
    shaded areas on the left and the right indicate border effects caused
    by  the window slices in that area not fully being inside time range of
    `x`:

    >>> fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(6., 4.))  # enlarge plot a bit
    >>> t_lo, t_hi = SFT.extent(N)[:2]  # time range of plot
    >>> ax1.set_title(rf"STFT ({SFT.m_num*SFT.T:g}$\,s$ Gaussian window, " +
    ...               rf"$\sigma_t={g_std*SFT.T}\,$s)")
    >>> ax1.set(xlabel=f"Time $t$ in seconds ({SFT.p_num(N)} slices, " +
    ...                rf"$\Delta t = {SFT.delta_t:g}\,$s)",
    ...         ylabel=f"Freq. $f$ in Hz ({SFT.f_pts} bins, " +
    ...                rf"$\Delta f = {SFT.delta_f:g}\,$Hz)",
    ...         xlim=(t_lo, t_hi))
    ...
    >>> im1 = ax1.imshow(abs(Sx), origin='lower', aspect='auto',
    ...                  extent=SFT.extent(N), cmap='viridis')
    >>> ax1.plot(t_x, f_i, 'r--', alpha=.5, label='$f_i(t)$')
    >>> fig1.colorbar(im1, label="Magnitude $|S_x(t, f)|$")
    ...
    >>> # Shade areas where window slices stick out to the side:
    >>> for t0_, t1_ in [(t_lo, SFT.lower_border_end[0] * SFT.T),
    ...                  (SFT.upper_border_begin(N)[0] * SFT.T, t_hi)]:
    ...     ax1.axvspan(t0_, t1_, color='w', linewidth=0, alpha=.2)
    >>> for t_ in [0, N * SFT.T]:  # mark signal borders with vertical line:
    ...     ax1.axvline(t_, color='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
    >>> ax1.legend()
    >>> fig1.tight_layout()
    >>> plt.show()

    Reconstructing the signal with the `~ShortTimeFFT.istft` is
    straightforward, but note that the length of `x1` should be specified,
    since the SFT length increases in `hop` steps:

    >>> SFT.invertible  # check if invertible
    True
    >>> x1 = SFT.istft(Sx, k1=N)
    >>> np.allclose(x, x1)
    True

    It is possible to calculate the SFT of signal parts:

    >>> p_q = SFT.nearest_k_p(N // 2)
    >>> Sx0 = SFT.stft(x[:p_q])
    >>> Sx1 = SFT.stft(x[p_q:])

    When assembling sequential STFT parts together, the overlap needs to be
    considered:

    >>> p0_ub = SFT.upper_border_begin(p_q)[1] - SFT.p_min
    >>> p1_le = SFT.lower_border_end[1] - SFT.p_min
    >>> Sx01 = np.hstack((Sx0[:, :p0_ub],
    ...                   Sx0[:, p0_ub:] + Sx1[:, :p1_le],
    ...                   Sx1[:, p1_le:]))
    >>> np.allclose(Sx01, Sx)  # Compare with SFT of complete signal
    True

    It is also possible to calculate the `itsft` for signal parts:

    >>> y_p = SFT.istft(Sx, N//3, N//2)
    >>> np.allclose(y_p, x[N//3:N//2])
    True

        r"""Instantiate a `ShortTimeFFT` by only providing a dual window.

        If an STFT is invertible, it is possible to calculate the window `win`
        from a given dual window `dual_win`. All other parameters have the
        same meaning as in the initializer of `ShortTimeFFT`.

        As explained in the :ref:`tutorial_stft` section of the
        :ref:`user_guide`, an invertible STFT can be interpreted as series
        expansion of time-shifted and frequency modulated dual windows. E.g.,
        the series coefficient S[q,p] belongs to the term, which shifted
        `dual_win` by p * `delta_t` and multiplied it by
        exp( 2 * j * pi * t * q * `delta_f`).


        Examples
        --------
        The following example discusses decomposing a signal into time- and
        frequency-shifted Gaussians. A Gaussian with standard deviation of
        one made up of 51 samples will be used:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> from scipy.signal import ShortTimeFFT
        >>> from scipy.signal.windows import gaussian
        ...
        >>> T, N = 0.1, 51
        >>> d_win = gaussian(N, std=1/T, sym=True)  # symmetric Gaussian window
        >>> t = T * (np.arange(N) - N//2)
        ...
        >>> fg1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
        >>> ax1.set_title(r"Dual Window: Gaussian with $\sigma_t=1$")
        >>> ax1.set(xlabel=f"Time $t$ in seconds ({N} samples, $T={T}$ s)",
        ...        xlim=(t[0], t[-1]), ylim=(0, 1.1*max(d_win)))
        >>> ax1.plot(t, d_win, 'C0-')

        The following plot with the overlap of 41, 11 and 2 samples show how
        the `hop` interval affects the shape of the window `win`:

        >>> fig2, axx = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex='all')
        ...
        >>> axx[0].set_title(r"Windows for hop$\in\{10, 40, 49\}$")
        >>> for c_, h_ in enumerate([10, 40, 49]):
        ...     SFT = ShortTimeFFT.from_dual(d_win, h_, 1/T)
        ...     axx[c_].plot(t + h_ * T, SFT.win, 'k--', alpha=.3, label=None)
        ...     axx[c_].plot(t - h_ * T, SFT.win, 'k:', alpha=.3, label=None)
        ...     axx[c_].plot(t, SFT.win, f'C{c_+1}',
        ...                     label=r"$\Delta t=%0.1f\,$s" % SFT.delta_t)
        ...     axx[c_].set_ylim(0, 1.1*max(SFT.win))
        ...     axx[c_].legend(loc='center')
        >>> axx[-1].set(xlabel=f"Time $t$ in seconds ({N} samples, $T={T}$ s)",
        ...             xlim=(t[0], t[-1]))
        >>> plt.show()

        Beside the window `win` centered at t = 0 the previous (t = -`delta_t`)
        and following window (t = `delta_t`) are depicted. It can be seen that
        for small `hop` intervals, the window is compact and smooth, having a
        good time-frequency concentration in the STFT. For the large `hop`
        interval of 4.9 s, the window has small values around t = 0, which are
        not covered by the overlap of the adjacent windows, which could lead to
        numeric inaccuracies. Furthermore, the peaky shape at the beginning and
        the end of the window points to a higher bandwidth, resulting in a
        poorer time-frequency resolution of the STFT.
        Hence, the choice of the `hop` interval will be a compromise between
        a time-frequency resolution and memory requirements demanded by small
        `hop` sizes.

        since they more inline with other classical STFT libraries.

        Parameters
        ----------
        win_param: Union[str, tuple, float],
            Parameters passed to `get_window`. For windows with no parameters,
            it may be a string (e.g., ``'hann'``), for parametrized windows a
            tuple, (e.g., ``('gaussian', 2.)``) or a single float specifying
            the shape parameter of a kaiser window (i.e. ``4.``  and
            ``('kaiser', 4.)`` are equal. See `get_window` for more details.
        fs : float
            Sampling frequency of input signal. Its relation to the
            sampling interval `T` is ``T = 1 / fs``.
        nperseg: int
            Window length in samples, which corresponds to the `m_num`.
        noverlap: int
            Window overlap in samples. It relates to the `hop` increment by
            ``hop = npsereg - noverlap``.
        symmetric_win: bool
            If ``True`` then a symmetric window is generated, else a periodic
            window is generated (default). Though symmetric windows seem for
            most applications to be more sensible, the default of a periodic
            windows was chosen to correspond to the default of `get_window`.
        fft_mode : 'twosided', 'centered', 'onesided', 'onesided2X'
            Mode of FFT to be used (default 'onesided').
            See property `fft_mode` for details.
        mfft: int | None
            Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired.
            If ``None`` (default), the length of the window `win` is used.
        scale_to : 'magnitude', 'psd' | None
            If not ``None`` (default) the window function is scaled, so each
            STFT column represents  either a 'magnitude' or a power spectral
            density ('psd') spectrum. This parameter sets the property
            `scaling` to the same value. See method `scale_to` for details.
        phase_shift : int | None
            If set, add a linear phase `phase_shift` / `mfft` * `f` to each
            frequency `f`. The default value 0 ensures that there is no phase
            shift on the zeroth slice (in which t=0 is centered). See property
            `phase_shift` for more details.

            Kind of values which are added, when the sliding window sticks out
            on either the lower or upper end of the input `x`. Zeros are added
            if the default 'zeros' is set. For 'edge' either the first or the

        The following example shows the spectrogram of a square wave with
        varying frequency :math:`f_i(t)` (marked by a green dashed line in the
        plot) sampled with 20 Hz:

        >>> x = square(2*np.pi*np.cumsum(f_i)*T_x)  # the signal

        The utilized Gaussian window is 50 samples or 2.5 s long. The
        parameter ``mfft=800`` (oversampling factor 16) and the `hop` interval
        of 2 in `ShortTimeFFT` was chosen to produce a sufficient number of
        points:

        >>> g_std = 12  # standard deviation for Gaussian window in samples
        >>> win = gaussian(50, std=g_std, sym=True)  # symmetric Gaussian wind.
        >>> SFT = ShortTimeFFT(win, hop=2, fs=1/T_x, mfft=800, scale_to='psd')
        >>> Sx2 = SFT.spectrogram(x)  # calculate absolute square of STFT

        The plot's colormap is logarithmically scaled as the power spectral
        density is in dB. The time extent of the signal `x` is marked by
        vertical dashed lines and the shaded areas mark the presence of border
        effects:

        The logarithmic scaling reveals the odd harmonics of the square wave,
        which are reflected at the Nyquist frequency of 10 Hz. This aliasing
        is also the main source of the noise artifacts in the plot.

        the bins are centered over the respective values when passing
