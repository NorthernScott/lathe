==================================
Input and output (:mod:`scipy.io`)
==================================

.. currentmodule:: scipy.io

SciPy has many modules, classes, and functions available to read data
from and write data to a variety of file formats.

.. seealso:: `NumPy IO routines <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.io.html>`__

MATLAB® files
=============

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   loadmat - Read a MATLAB style mat file (version 4 through 7.1)
   savemat - Write a MATLAB style mat file (version 4 through 7.1)
   whosmat - List contents of a MATLAB style mat file (version 4 through 7.1)

For low-level MATLAB reading and writing utilities, see `scipy.io.matlab`.
