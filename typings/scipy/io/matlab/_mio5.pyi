 Note on functions and mat files
=================================

The document above does not give any hints as to the storage of matlab
function handles, or anonymous function handles. I had, therefore, to
guess the format of matlab arrays of ``mxFUNCTION_CLASS`` and
``mxOPAQUE_CLASS`` by looking at example mat files.

``mxFUNCTION_CLASS`` stores all types of matlab functions. It seems to
contain a struct matrix with a set pattern of fields. For anonymous
functions, a sub-fields of one of these fields seems to contain the
well-named ``mxOPAQUE_CLASS``. This seems to contain:

* array flags as for any matlab matrix
* 3 int8 strings
* a matrix

It seems that whenever the mat file contains a ``mxOPAQUE_CLASS``
instance, there is also an un-named matrix (name == '') at the end of
the mat file. I'll call this the ``__function_workspace__`` matrix.

When I saved two anonymous functions in a mat file, or appended another
anonymous function to the mat file, there was still only one
``__function_workspace__`` un-named matrix at the end, but larger than
that for a mat file with a single anonymous function, suggesting that
the workspaces for the two functions had been merged.

The ``__function_workspace__`` matrix appears to be of double class
(``mxCLASS_DOUBLE``), but stored as uint8, the memory for which is in
the format of a mini .mat file, without the first 124 bytes of the file
header (the description and the subsystem_offset), but with the version
U2 bytes, and the S2 endian test bytes. There follow 4 zero bytes,
presumably for 8 byte padding, and then a series of ``miMATRIX``
entries, as in a standard mat file. The ``miMATRIX`` entries appear to
be series of un-named (name == '') matrices, and may also contain arrays
of this same mini-mat format.

I guess that:

* saving an anonymous function back to a mat file will need the
  associated ``__function_workspace__`` matrix saved as well for the
  anonymous function to work correctly.
* appending to a mat file that has a ``__function_workspace__`` would
  involve first pulling off this workspace, appending, checking whether
  there were any more anonymous functions appended, and then somehow
  merging the relevant workspaces, and saving at the end of the mat
  file.

The mat files I was playing with are in ``tests/data``:

* sqr.mat
* parabola.mat
* some_functions.mat

See ``tests/test_mio.py:test_mio_funcs.py`` for the debugging
script I was working with.

    """ Pull variables out of mat 5 file as a sequence of mat file objects

    This can be useful with a difficult mat file, containing unreadable
    variables. This routine pulls the variables out in raw form and puts them,
    unread, back into a file stream for saving or reading. Another use is the
    pathological case where there is more than one variable of the same name in
    the file; this routine returns the duplicates, whereas the standard reader
    will overwrite duplicates in the returned dictionary.

    The file pointer in `file_obj` will be undefined. File pointers for the
    returned file-like objects are set at 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_obj : file-like
        file object containing mat file

    Returns
    -------
    named_mats : list
        list contains tuples of (name, BytesIO) where BytesIO is a file-like
        object containing mat file contents as for a single variable. The
        BytesIO contains a string with the original header and a single var. If
        ``var_file_obj`` is an individual BytesIO instance, then save as a mat
        file with something like ``open('test.mat',
        'wb').write(var_file_obj.read())``
