"""Interior-point method for linear programming

The *interior-point* method uses the primal-dual path following algorithm
outlined in [1]_. This algorithm supports sparse constraint matrices and
is typically faster than the simplex methods, especially for large, sparse
problems. Note, however, that the solution returned may be slightly less
accurate than those of the simplex methods and will not, in general,
correspond with a vertex of the polytope defined by the constraints.
