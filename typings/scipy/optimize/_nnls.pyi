def nnls(A, b, maxiter=..., *, atol=...): # -> tuple[Any, Any]:
    """
    Solve ``argmin_x || Ax - b ||_2`` for ``x>=0``.

    This problem, often called as NonNegative Least Squares, is a convex
    optimization problem with convex constraints. It typically arises when
    the ``x`` models quantities for which only nonnegative values are
    attainable; weight of ingredients, component costs and so on.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : (m, n) ndarray
        Coefficient array
    b : (m,) ndarray, float
        Right-hand side vector.
    maxiter: int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations, optional. Default value is ``3 * n``.
    atol: float
        Tolerance value used in the algorithm to assess closeness to zero in
        the projected residual ``(A.T @ (A x - b)`` entries. Increasing this
        value relaxes the solution constraints. A typical relaxation value can
        be selected as ``max(m, n) * np.linalg.norm(a, 1) * np.spacing(1.)``.
        This value is not set as default since the norm operation becomes
        expensive for large problems hence can be used only when necessary.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        Solution vector.
    rnorm : float
        The 2-norm of the residual, ``|| Ax-b ||_2``.

    Notes
    -----
    The code is based on [2]_ which is an improved version of the classical
    algorithm of [1]_. It utilizes an active set method and solves the KKT
    (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) conditions for the non-negative least squares problem.
