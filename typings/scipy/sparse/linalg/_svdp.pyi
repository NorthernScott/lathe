Python wrapper for PROPACK
--------------------------

PROPACK is a collection of Fortran routines for iterative computation
of partial SVDs of large matrices or linear operators.

Based on BSD licensed pypropack project:
  http://github.com/jakevdp/pypropack
  Author: Jake Vanderplas <vanderplas@astro.washington.edu>

PROPACK source is BSD licensed, and available at
