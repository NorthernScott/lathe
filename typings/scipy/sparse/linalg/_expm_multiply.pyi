    The result is not deterministic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : LinearOperator
        Linear operator whose trace will be estimated. Has to be square.
    m3 : int
        Number of matrix-vector products divided by 3 used to estimate the
        trace.
    seed : optional
        Seed for `numpy.random.default_rng`.
        Can be provided to obtain deterministic results.

    Returns
    -------
    trace : LinearOperator.dtype
        Estimate of the trace

def expm_multiply(A, B, start=..., stop=..., num=..., endpoint=..., traceA=...):
    """
    Compute the action of the matrix exponential of A on B.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : transposable linear operator
        The operator whose exponential is of interest.
    B : ndarray
        The matrix or vector to be multiplied by the matrix exponential of A.
    start : scalar, optional
        The starting time point of the sequence.
    stop : scalar, optional
        The end time point of the sequence, unless `endpoint` is set to False.
        In that case, the sequence consists of all but the last of ``num + 1``
        evenly spaced time points, so that `stop` is excluded.
        Note that the step size changes when `endpoint` is False.
    num : int, optional
        Number of time points to use.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, `stop` is the last time point.  Otherwise, it is not included.
    traceA : scalar, optional
        Trace of `A`. If not given the trace is estimated for linear operators,
        or calculated exactly for sparse matrices. It is used to precondition
        `A`, thus an approximate trace is acceptable.
        For linear operators, `traceA` should be provided to ensure performance
        as the estimation is not guaranteed to be reliable for all cases.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Returns
    -------
    expm_A_B : ndarray
         The result of the action :math:`e^{t_k A} B`.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If `A` is a linear operator and ``traceA=None`` (default).

    Notes
    -----
    The optional arguments defining the sequence of evenly spaced time points
    are compatible with the arguments of `numpy.linspace`.

    The output ndarray shape is somewhat complicated so I explain it here.
    The ndim of the output could be either 1, 2, or 3.
    It would be 1 if you are computing the expm action on a single vector
    at a single time point.
    It would be 2 if you are computing the expm action on a vector
    at multiple time points, or if you are computing the expm action
    on a matrix at a single time point.
    It would be 3 if you want the action on a matrix with multiple
    columns at multiple time points.
    If multiple time points are requested, expm_A_B[0] will always
    be the action of the expm at the first time point,
    regardless of whether the action is on a vector or a matrix.
