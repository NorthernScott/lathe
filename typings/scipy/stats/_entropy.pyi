    """
    Calculate the Shannon entropy/relative entropy of given distribution(s).

    If only probabilities `pk` are given, the Shannon entropy is calculated as
    ``H = -sum(pk * log(pk))``.

    If `qk` is not None, then compute the relative entropy
    ``D = sum(pk * log(pk / qk))``. This quantity is also known
    as the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

    This routine will normalize `pk` and `qk` if they don't sum to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pk : array_like
        Defines the (discrete) distribution. Along each axis-slice of ``pk``,
        element ``i`` is the  (possibly unnormalized) probability of event
        ``i``.
    qk : array_like, optional
        Sequence against which the relative entropy is computed. Should be in
        the same format as `pk`.
    base : float, optional
        The logarithmic base to use, defaults to ``e`` (natural logarithm).
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the entropy is calculated. Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    S : {float, array_like}
        The calculated entropy.

    Notes
    -----
    Informally, the Shannon entropy quantifies the expected uncertainty
    inherent in the possible outcomes of a discrete random variable.
    For example,
    if messages consisting of sequences of symbols from a set are to be
    encoded and transmitted over a noiseless channel, then the Shannon entropy
    ``H(pk)`` gives a tight lower bound for the average number of units of
    information needed per symbol if the symbols occur with frequencies
    governed by the discrete distribution `pk` [1]_. The choice of base
    determines the choice of units; e.g., ``e`` for nats, ``2`` for bits, etc.

    The relative entropy, ``D(pk|qk)``, quantifies the increase in the average
    number of units of information needed per symbol if the encoding is
    optimized for the probability distribution `qk` instead of the true
    distribution `pk`. Informally, the relative entropy quantifies the expected
    excess in surprise experienced if one believes the true distribution is
    `qk` when it is actually `pk`.

    A related quantity, the cross entropy ``CE(pk, qk)``, satisfies the
    equation ``CE(pk, qk) = H(pk) + D(pk|qk)`` and can also be calculated with
    the formula ``CE = -sum(pk * log(qk))``. It gives the average
    number of units of information needed per symbol if an encoding is
    optimized for the probability distribution `qk` when the true distribution
    is `pk`. It is not computed directly by `entropy`, but it can be computed
    using two calls to the function (see Examples).

    See [2]_ for more information.

    Examples
    --------
    The outcome of a fair coin is the most uncertain:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import entropy
    >>> base = 2  # work in units of bits
    >>> pk = np.array([1/2, 1/2])  # fair coin
    >>> H = entropy(pk, base=base)
    >>> H
    1.0
    >>> H == -np.sum(pk * np.log(pk)) / np.log(base)
    True

    The outcome of a biased coin is less uncertain:

    >>> qk = np.array([9/10, 1/10])  # biased coin
    >>> entropy(qk, base=base)
    0.46899559358928117

    The relative entropy between the fair coin and biased coin is calculated
    as:

    >>> D = entropy(pk, qk, base=base)
    >>> D
    0.7369655941662062
    >>> np.isclose(D, np.sum(pk * np.log(pk/qk)) / np.log(base), rtol=4e-16, atol=0)
    True

    The cross entropy can be calculated as the sum of the entropy and
    relative entropy`:

    >>> CE = entropy(pk, base=base) + entropy(pk, qk, base=base)
    >>> CE
    1.736965594166206
    >>> CE == -np.sum(pk * np.log(qk)) / np.log(base)
    True

    r"""Given a sample of a distribution, estimate the differential entropy.

    Several estimation methods are available using the `method` parameter. By
    default, a method is selected based the size of the sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : sequence
        Sample from a continuous distribution.
    window_length : int, optional
        Window length for computing Vasicek estimate. Must be an integer
        between 1 and half of the sample size. If ``None`` (the default), it
        uses the heuristic value

        .. math::
            \left \lfloor \sqrt{n} + 0.5 \right \rfloor

        where :math:`n` is the sample size. This heuristic was originally
        proposed in [2]_ and has become common in the literature.
    base : float, optional
        The logarithmic base to use, defaults to ``e`` (natural logarithm).
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the differential entropy is calculated.
        Default is 0.
    method : {'vasicek', 'van es', 'ebrahimi', 'correa', 'auto'}, optional
        The method used to estimate the differential entropy from the sample.
        Default is ``'auto'``.  See Notes for more information.

    Returns
    -------
    entropy : float
        The calculated differential entropy.

    Notes
    -----
    This function will converge to the true differential entropy in the limit

    .. math::
        n \to \infty, \quad m \to \infty, \quad \frac{m}{n} \to 0

    The optimal choice of ``window_length`` for a given sample size depends on
    the (unknown) distribution. Typically, the smoother the density of the
    distribution, the larger the optimal value of ``window_length`` [1]_.

    The following options are available for the `method` parameter.

    * ``'vasicek'`` uses the estimator presented in [1]_. This is
      one of the first and most influential estimators of differential entropy.
    * ``'van es'`` uses the bias-corrected estimator presented in [3]_, which
      is not only consistent but, under some conditions, asymptotically normal.
    * ``'ebrahimi'`` uses an estimator presented in [4]_, which was shown
      in simulation to have smaller bias and mean squared error than
      the Vasicek estimator.
    * ``'correa'`` uses the estimator presented in [5]_ based on local linear
      regression. In a simulation study, it had consistently smaller mean
      square error than the Vasiceck estimator, but it is more expensive to
      compute.
    * ``'auto'`` selects the method automatically (default). Currently,
      this selects ``'van es'`` for very small samples (<10), ``'ebrahimi'``
      for moderate sample sizes (11-1000), and ``'vasicek'`` for larger
      samples, but this behavior is subject to change in future versions.

    All estimators are implemented as described in [6]_.

    Entropy of a standard normal distribution:

    >>> values = rng.standard_normal(100)
    >>> differential_entropy(values)
    1.3407817436640392

    Compare with the true entropy:

    >>> float(norm.entropy())

    For several sample sizes between 5 and 1000, compare the accuracy of
    the ``'vasicek'``, ``'van es'``, and ``'ebrahimi'`` methods. Specifically,
    compare the root mean squared error (over 1000 trials) between the estimate
    and the true differential entropy of the distribution.
