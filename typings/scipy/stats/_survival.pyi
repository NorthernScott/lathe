            An object representing the empirical survival function.

            Evaluate the CDF/SF at the argument.

        plot(ax) :
            Plot the CDF/SF on the provided axes.

            Compute the confidence interval around the CDF/SF at the values in
            `quantiles`.

    Notes
    -----
    When each observation of the sample is a precise measurement, the ECDF
    steps up by ``1/len(sample)`` at each of the observations [1]_.

    When observations are lower bounds, upper bounds, or both upper and lower
    bounds, the data is said to be "censored", and `sample` may be provided as
    an instance of `scipy.stats.CensoredData`.

    For right-censored data, the ECDF is given by the Kaplan-Meier estimator
    [2]_; other forms of censoring are not supported at this time.

    Confidence intervals are computed according to the Greenwood formula or the
    more recent "Exponential Greenwood" formula as described in [4]_.

    Examples
    --------
    **Uncensored Data**

    As in the example from [1]_ page 79, five boys were selected at random from
    those in a single high school. Their one-mile run times were recorded as
    follows.

    >>> sample = [6.23, 5.58, 7.06, 6.42, 5.20]  # one-mile run times (minutes)

    The empirical distribution function, which approximates the distribution
    function of one-mile run times of the population from which the boys were
    sampled, is calculated as follows.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.ecdf(sample)
    >>> res.cdf.quantiles
    array([5.2 , 5.58, 6.23, 6.42, 7.06])
    >>> res.cdf.probabilities
    array([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. ])

    To plot the result as a step function:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> res.cdf.plot(ax)
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('One-Mile Run Time (minutes)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical CDF')
    >>> plt.show()

    **Right-censored Data**

    As in the example from [1]_ page 91, the lives of ten car fanbelts were
    tested. Five tests concluded because the fanbelt being tested broke, but
    the remaining tests concluded for other reasons (e.g. the study ran out of
    funding, but the fanbelt was still functional). The mileage driven
    with the fanbelts were recorded as follows.

    >>> broken = [77, 47, 81, 56, 80]  # in thousands of miles driven
    >>> unbroken = [62, 60, 43, 71, 37]

    Precise survival times of the fanbelts that were still functional at the
    end of the tests are unknown, but they are known to exceed the values
    recorded in ``unbroken``. Therefore, these observations are said to be
    "right-censored", and the data is represented using
    `scipy.stats.CensoredData`.

    >>> sample = stats.CensoredData(uncensored=broken, right=unbroken)

    The empirical survival function is calculated as follows.

    >>> res = stats.ecdf(sample)
    >>> res.sf.quantiles
    array([37., 43., 47., 56., 60., 62., 71., 77., 80., 81.])
    >>> res.sf.probabilities
    array([1.   , 1.   , 0.875, 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.5  , 0.25 , 0.   ])

    To plot the result as a step function:

    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> res.sf.plot(ax)
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('Fanbelt Survival Time (thousands of miles)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical SF')
    >>> plt.show()

          function is less than the group *Y* failure rate function at some
          times.
        * 'greater': survival of group *Y* is favored: the group *X* failure
          rate function is greater than the group *Y* failure rate function at
          some times.

    Notes
    -----
    The logrank test [1]_ compares the observed number of events to
    the expected number of events under the null hypothesis that the two
    samples were drawn from the same distribution. The statistic is

    .. math::

        Z_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J(O_{i,j}-E_{i,j})}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^J V_{i,j}}}
        \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,1)

    where

    .. math::

        E_{i,j} = O_j \frac{N_{i,j}}{N_j},
        \qquad
        V_{i,j} = E_{i,j} \left(\frac{N_j-O_j}{N_j}\right)
        \left(\frac{N_j-N_{i,j}}{N_j-1}\right),

    :math:`i` denotes the group (i.e. it may assume values :math:`x` or
    :math:`y`, or it may be omitted to refer to the combined sample)
    :math:`j` denotes the time (at which an event occurred),
    :math:`N` is the number of subjects at risk just before an event occurred,
    and :math:`O` is the observed number of events at that time.

    The ``statistic`` :math:`Z_x` returned by `logrank` is the (signed) square
    root of the statistic returned by many other implementations. Under the
    null hypothesis, :math:`Z_x**2` is asymptotically distributed according to
    the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. Consequently,
    :math:`Z_x` is asymptotically distributed according to the standard normal
    distribution. The advantage of using :math:`Z_x` is that the sign
    information (i.e. whether the observed number of events tends to be less
    than or greater than the number expected under the null hypothesis) is
    preserved, allowing `scipy.stats.logrank` to offer one-sided alternative
    hypotheses.

    Examples
    --------
    Reference [2]_ compared the survival times of patients with two different
    types of recurrent malignant gliomas. The samples below record the time
    (number of weeks) for which each patient participated in the study. The
    `scipy.stats.CensoredData` class is used because the data is
    right-censored: the uncensored observations correspond with observed deaths
    whereas the censored observations correspond with the patient leaving the
    study for another reason.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> x = stats.CensoredData(
    ...     uncensored=[6, 13, 21, 30, 37, 38, 49, 50,
    ...                 63, 79, 86, 98, 202, 219],
    ...     right=[31, 47, 80, 82, 82, 149]
    ... )
    >>> y = stats.CensoredData(
    ...     uncensored=[10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24, 24,
    ...                 25, 28,30, 33, 35, 37, 40, 40, 46, 48, 76, 81,
    ...                 82, 91, 112, 181],
    ...     right=[34, 40, 70]
    ... )

    We can calculate and visualize the empirical survival functions
    of both groups as follows.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ecdf_x = stats.ecdf(x)
    >>> ecdf_x.sf.plot(ax, label='Astrocytoma')
    >>> ecdf_y = stats.ecdf(y)
    >>> ecdf_y.sf.plot(ax, label='Glioblastoma')
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('Time to death (weeks)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical SF')
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

    Visual inspection of the empirical survival functions suggests that the
    survival times tend to be different between the two groups. To formally
    assess whether the difference is significant at the 1% level, we use the
    logrank test.

    >>> res = stats.logrank(x=x, y=y)
    >>> res.statistic
    -2.73799
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.00618

    The p-value is less than 1%, so we can consider the data to be evidence
    against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative that there is a
    difference between the two survival functions.
