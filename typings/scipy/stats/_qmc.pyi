    Notes
    -----
    The discrepancy is a uniformity criterion used to assess the space filling
    of a number of samples in a hypercube. A discrepancy quantifies the
    distance between the continuous uniform distribution on a hypercube and the
    discrete uniform distribution on :math:`n` distinct sample points.

    The lower the value is, the better the coverage of the parameter space is.

    For a collection of subsets of the hypercube, the discrepancy is the
    difference between the fraction of sample points in one of those
    subsets and the volume of that subset. There are different definitions of
    discrepancy corresponding to different collections of subsets. Some
    versions take a root mean square difference over subsets instead of
    a maximum.

    A measure of uniformity is reasonable if it satisfies the following
    criteria [1]_:

    1. It is invariant under permuting factors and/or runs.
    2. It is invariant under rotation of the coordinates.
    3. It can measure not only uniformity of the sample over the hypercube,
       but also the projection uniformity of the sample over non-empty
       subset of lower dimension hypercubes.
    4. There is some reasonable geometric meaning.
    5. It is easy to compute.
    6. It satisfies the Koksma-Hlawka-like inequality.
    7. It is consistent with other criteria in experimental design.

    Four methods are available:

    * ``CD``: Centered Discrepancy - subspace involves a corner of the
      hypercube
    * ``WD``: Wrap-around Discrepancy - subspace can wrap around bounds
    * ``MD``: Mixture Discrepancy - mix between CD/WD covering more criteria
    * ``L2-star``: L2-star discrepancy - like CD BUT variant to rotation

    See [2]_ for precise definitions of each method.

    Lastly, using ``iterative=True``, it is possible to compute the
    discrepancy as if we had :math:`n+1` samples. This is useful if we want
    to add a point to a sampling and check the candidate which would give the
    lowest discrepancy. Then you could just update the discrepancy with
    each candidate using `update_discrepancy`. This method is faster than
    computing the discrepancy for a large number of candidates.

    See Also
    --------
    discrepancy

    Notes
    -----
    The discrepancy can serve as a simple measure of quality of a random sample.
    This measure is based on the geometric properties of the distribution of points
    in the sample, such as the minimum distance between any pair of points, or
    the mean edge length in a minimum spanning tree.

    The higher the value is, the better the coverage of the parameter space is.
    Note that this is different from `scipy.stats.qmc.discrepancy`, where lower
    values correspond to higher quality of the sample.

    Also note that when comparing different sampling strategies using this function,
    the sample size must be kept constant.

    It is possible to calculate two metrics from the minimum spanning tree:
    the mean edge length and the standard deviation of edges lengths. Using
    both metrics offers a better picture of uniformity than either metric alone,
    with higher mean and lower standard deviation being preferable (see [1]_
    for a brief discussion). This function currently only calculates the mean
    edge length.

    Notes
    -----
    By convention samples are distributed over the half-open interval
    ``[0, 1)``. Instances of the class can access the attributes: ``d`` for
    the dimension; and ``rng`` for the random number generator.

    **Subclassing**

    When subclassing `QMCEngine` to create a new sampler,  ``__init__`` and
    ``random`` must be redefined.

    * ``__init__(d, rng=None)``: at least fix the dimension. If the sampler
      does not take advantage of a ``rng`` (deterministic methods like
      Halton), this parameter can be omitted.
    * ``_random(n, *, workers=1)``: draw ``n`` from the engine. ``workers``
      is used for parallelism. See `Halton` for example.

    Optionally, two other methods can be overwritten by subclasses:

    * ``reset``: Reset the engine to its original state.
    * ``fast_forward``: If the sequence is deterministic (like Halton
      sequence), then ``fast_forward(n)`` is skipping the ``n`` first draw.

    Examples
    --------
    To create a random sampler based on ``np.random.random``, we would do the
    following:

    >>> from scipy.stats import qmc
    >>> class RandomEngine(qmc.QMCEngine):
    ...     def __init__(self, d, rng=None):
    ...         super().__init__(d=d, rng=rng)
    ...
    ...
    ...     def _random(self, n=1, *, workers=1):
    ...         return self.rng.random((n, self.d))
    ...
    ...
    ...     def reset(self):
    ...         super().__init__(d=self.d, rng=self.rng_seed)
    ...         return self
    ...
    ...
    ...     def fast_forward(self, n):
    ...         self.random(n)
    ...         return self

    After subclassing `QMCEngine` to define the sampling strategy we want to
    use, we can create an instance to sample from.

    >>> engine = RandomEngine(2)
    >>> engine.random(5)
    array([[0.22733602, 0.31675834],  # random
           [0.79736546, 0.67625467],

           [0.67275604, 0.94180287]])

    We can also reset the state of the generator and resample again.

    >>> _ = engine.reset()
    >>> engine.random(5)

        Parameters
        ----------
        l_bounds : int or array-like of ints
            Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn (unless ``u_bounds=None``,
            in which case this parameter is 0 and this value is used for

            If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
            (see above for behavior if ``u_bounds=None``).
            If array-like, must contain integer values.

        Notes
        -----
        It is safe to just use the same ``[0, 1)`` to integer mapping
        with QMC that you would use with MC. You still get unbiasedness,
        a strong law of large numbers, an asymptotically infinite variance
        reduction and a finite sample variance bound.

        To convert a sample from :math:`[0, 1)` to :math:`[a, b), b>a`,
        with :math:`a` the lower bounds and :math:`b` the upper bounds,
        the following transformation is used:

    Notes
    -----

    When LHS is used for integrating a function :math:`f` over :math:`n`,
    LHS is extremely effective on integrands that are nearly additive [2]_.
    With a LHS of :math:`n` points, the variance of the integral is always
    lower than plain MC on :math:`n-1` points [3]_. There is a central limit
    theorem for LHS on the mean and variance of the integral [4]_, but not
    necessarily for optimized LHS due to the randomization.

    :math:`A` is called an orthogonal array of strength :math:`t` if in each
    n-row-by-t-column submatrix of :math:`A`: all :math:`p^t` possible
    distinct rows occur the same number of times. The elements of :math:`A`
    are in the set :math:`\{0, 1, ..., p-1\}`, also called symbols.
    The constraint that :math:`p` must be a prime number is to allow modular
    arithmetic. Increasing strength adds some symmetry to the sub-projections
    of a sample. With strength 2, samples are symmetric along the diagonals of
    2D sub-projections. This may be undesirable, but on the other hand, the
    sample dispersion is improved.

    Strength 1 (plain LHS) brings an advantage over strength 0 (MC) and
    strength 2 is a useful increment over strength 1. Going to strength 3 is
    a smaller increment and scrambled QMC like Sobol', Halton are more
    performant [7]_.

    To create a LHS of strength 2, the orthogonal array :math:`A` is
    randomized by applying a random, bijective map of the set of symbols onto
    itself. For example, in column 0, all 0s might become 2; in column 1,
    all 0s might become 1, etc.
    Then, for each column :math:`i` and symbol :math:`j`, we add a plain,
    one-dimensional LHS of size :math:`p` to the subarray where
    :math:`A^i = j`. The resulting matrix is finally divided by :math:`p`.

    >>> qmc.discrepancy(sample)
    0.0196...  # random

    Use the `optimization` keyword argument to produce a LHS with
    lower discrepancy at higher computational cost.

    >>> sampler = qmc.LatinHypercube(d=2, optimization="random-cd")
    >>> sample = sampler.random(n=5)
    >>> qmc.discrepancy(sample)
    0.0176...  # random

    Use the `strength` keyword argument to produce an orthogonal array based
    LHS of strength 2. In this case, the number of sample points must be the
    square of a prime number.

    >>> sampler = qmc.LatinHypercube(d=2, strength=2)
    >>> sample = sampler.random(n=9)
    >>> qmc.discrepancy(sample)
    0.00526...  # random

    Options could be combined to produce an optimized centered
    orthogonal array based LHS. After optimization, the result would not
    be guaranteed to be of strength 2.

    **Real-world example**

    In [9]_, a Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) strategy was used to sample a
    parameter space to study the importance of each parameter of an epidemic
    model. Such analysis is also called a sensitivity analysis.

    Since the dimensionality of the problem is high (6), it is computationally
    expensive to cover the space. When numerical experiments are costly, QMC
    enables analysis that may not be possible if using a grid.

    The six parameters of the model represented the probability of illness,
    the probability of withdrawal, and four contact probabilities. The
    authors assumed uniform distributions for all parameters and generated
    50 samples.

    Using `scipy.stats.qmc.LatinHypercube` to replicate the protocol,
    the first step is to create a sample in the unit hypercube:

    >>> from scipy.stats import qmc
    >>> sampler = qmc.LatinHypercube(d=6)
    >>> sample = sampler.random(n=50)

    Then the sample can be scaled to the appropriate bounds:

    >>> l_bounds = [0.000125, 0.01, 0.0025, 0.05, 0.47, 0.7]
    >>> u_bounds = [0.000375, 0.03, 0.0075, 0.15, 0.87, 0.9]
    >>> sample_scaled = qmc.scale(sample, l_bounds, u_bounds)

    Such a sample was used to run the model 50 times, and a polynomial
    response surface was constructed. This allowed the authors to study the
    relative importance of each parameter across the range of possibilities
    of every other parameter.

    In this computer experiment, they showed a 14-fold reduction in the
    number of samples required to maintain an error below 2% on their
    response surface when compared to a grid sampling.

    Notes
    -----
    Sobol' sequences [1]_ provide :math:`n=2^m` low discrepancy points in
    :math:`[0,1)^{d}`. Scrambling them [3]_ makes them suitable for singular
    integrands, provides a means of error estimation, and can improve their
    rate of convergence. The scrambling strategy which is implemented is a
    (left) linear matrix scramble (LMS) followed by a digital random shift
    (LMS+shift) [2]_.

    There are many versions of Sobol' sequences depending on their
    'direction numbers'. This code uses direction numbers from [4]_. Hence,
    the maximum number of dimension is 21201. The direction numbers have been
    precomputed with search criterion 6 and can be retrieved at
    https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/sobol/.

    .. warning::

       Sobol' sequences are a quadrature rule and they lose their balance
       properties if one uses a sample size that is not a power of 2, or skips
       the first point, or thins the sequence [5]_.

       If :math:`n=2^m` points are not enough then one should take :math:`2^M`
       points for :math:`M>m`. When scrambling, the number R of independent
       replicates does not have to be a power of 2.

       Sobol' sequences are generated to some number :math:`B` of bits.
       After :math:`2^B` points have been generated, the sequence would
       repeat. Hence, an error is raised.
       The number of bits can be controlled with the parameter `bits`.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate samples from a low discrepancy sequence of Sobol'.

    >>> from scipy.stats import qmc
    >>> sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=2, scramble=False)
    >>> sample = sampler.random_base2(m=3)
    >>> sample
    array([[0.   , 0.   ],
           [0.5  , 0.5  ],
           [0.75 , 0.25 ],
           [0.25 , 0.75 ],
           [0.375, 0.375],
           [0.875, 0.875],
           [0.625, 0.125],
           [0.125, 0.625]])

    Compute the quality of the sample using the discrepancy criterion.

    >>> qmc.discrepancy(sample)
    0.013882107204860938

    To continue an existing design, extra points can be obtained
    by calling again `random_base2`. Alternatively, you can skip some
    points like:

    >>> _ = sampler.reset()
    >>> _ = sampler.fast_forward(4)
    >>> sample_continued = sampler.random_base2(m=2)
    >>> sample_continued
    array([[0.375, 0.375],
           [0.875, 0.875],
           [0.625, 0.125],
           [0.125, 0.625]])

    Finally, samples can be scaled to bounds.

    >>> l_bounds = [0, 2]
    >>> u_bounds = [10, 5]
    >>> qmc.scale(sample_continued, l_bounds, u_bounds)
    array([[3.75 , 3.125],
           [8.75 , 4.625],
           [6.25 , 2.375],

    l_bounds, u_bounds : array_like (d,)

    Notes
    -----
    Poisson disk sampling is an iterative sampling strategy. Starting from
    a seed sample, `ncandidates` are sampled in the hypersphere
    surrounding the seed. Candidates below a certain `radius` or outside the
    domain are rejected. New samples are added in a pool of sample seed. The
    process stops when the pool is empty or when the number of required
    samples is reached.

    The maximum number of point that a sample can contain is directly linked
    to the `radius`. As the dimension of the space increases, a higher radius
    spreads the points further and help overcome the curse of dimensionality.
    See the :ref:`quasi monte carlo tutorial <quasi-monte-carlo>` for more
    details.

    .. warning::

       The algorithm is more suitable for low dimensions and sampling size
       due to its iterative nature and memory requirements.
       Selecting a small radius with a high dimension would
       mean that the space could contain more samples than using lower
       dimension or a bigger radius.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate a 2D sample using a `radius` of 0.2.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from matplotlib.collections import PatchCollection
    >>> from scipy.stats import qmc
    >>>
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> radius = 0.2
    >>> engine = qmc.PoissonDisk(d=2, radius=radius, rng=rng)
    >>> sample = engine.random(20)

    Visualizing the 2D sample and showing that no points are closer than
    `radius`. ``radius/2`` is used to visualize non-intersecting circles.
    If two samples are exactly at `radius` from each other, then their circle
    of radius ``radius/2`` will touch.

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> _ = ax.scatter(sample[:, 0], sample[:, 1])
    >>> circles = [plt.Circle((xi, yi), radius=radius/2, fill=False)
    ...            for xi, yi in sample]
    >>> collection = PatchCollection(circles, match_original=True)
    >>> ax.add_collection(collection)
    >>> _ = ax.set(aspect='equal', xlabel=r'$x_1$', ylabel=r'$x_2$',
    ...            xlim=[0, 1], ylim=[0, 1])
    >>> plt.show()

    Such visualization can be seen as circle packing: how many circle can
    we put in the space. It is a np-hard problem. The method `fill_space`
    can be used to add samples until no more samples can be added. This is
    a hard problem and parameters may need to be adjusted manually. Beware of
    the dimension: as the dimensionality increases, the number of samples
    required to fill the space increases exponentially
    (curse-of-dimensionality).
