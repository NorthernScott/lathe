    The weighted geometric mean of the array :math:`a_i` associated to weights

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which the geometric mean is computed. Default is 0.
        If None, compute over the whole array `a`.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to which the input arrays are cast before the calculation is
        performed.
    weights : array_like, optional
        The `weights` array must be broadcastable to the same shape as `a`.
        Default is None, which gives each value a weight of 1.0.

    Notes
    -----
    The sample geometric mean is the exponential of the mean of the natural
    logarithms of the observations.
    Negative observations will produce NaNs in the output because the *natural*
    logarithm (as opposed to the *complex* logarithm) is defined only for
    non-negative reals.

    The sample harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the mean of the reciprocals
    of the observations.

    The harmonic mean is computed over a single dimension of the input

    float64 intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    The harmonic mean is only defined if all observations are non-negative;
    otherwise, the result is NaN.

    ----------
    a : array_like

    The mode  is calculated using `numpy.unique`.
    In NumPy versions 1.21 and after, all NaNs - even those with different
    binary representations - are treated as equivalent and counted as separate
    instances of the same value.

def moment(a, order=..., axis=..., nan_policy=..., *, center=...): # -> Any:
    r"""Calculate the nth moment about the mean for a sample.

    A moment is a specific quantitative measure of the shape of a set of
    points. It is often used to calculate coefficients of skewness and kurtosis
    due to its close relationship with them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
       Input array.
    order : int or 1-D array_like of ints, optional
       Order of central moment that is returned. Default is 1.
    axis : int or None, optional
       Axis along which the central moment is computed. Default is 0.
       If None, compute over the whole array `a`.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    center : float or None, optional
       The point about which moments are taken. This can be the sample mean,
       the origin, or any other be point. If `None` (default) compute the
       center as the sample mean.

    Returns
    -------
    n-th moment about the `center` : ndarray or float
       The appropriate moment along the given axis or over all values if axis
       is None. The denominator for the moment calculation is the number of
       observations, no degrees of freedom correction is done.

    --------
    kurtosis, skew, describe

    Notes
    -----
    The k-th moment of a data sample is:

    .. math::

        m_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - c)^k

    Where `n` is the number of samples, and `c` is the center around which the
    moment is calculated. This function uses exponentiation by squares [1]_ for
    efficiency.

    Note that, if `a` is an empty array (``a.size == 0``), array `moment` with
    one element (`moment.size == 1`) is treated the same as scalar `moment`
    (``np.isscalar(moment)``). This might produce arrays of unexpected shape.

    For normally distributed data, the skewness should be about zero. For
    unimodal continuous distributions, a skewness value greater than zero means
    that there is more weight in the right tail of the distribution. The
    function `skewtest` can be used to determine if the skewness value
    is close enough to zero, statistically speaking.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which skewness is calculated. Default is 0.
        If None, compute over the whole array `a`.

    Returns
    -------
    skewness : ndarray
        The skewness of values along an axis, returning NaN where all values

    Notes
    -----
    The sample skewness is computed as the Fisher-Pearson coefficient
    of skewness, i.e.

    .. math::

    where

    .. math::

    is the biased sample :math:`i\texttt{th}` central moment, and
    :math:`\bar{x}` is
    the sample mean.  If ``bias`` is False, the calculations are
    corrected for bias and the value computed is the adjusted
    Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient, i.e.

    .. math::

        G_1=\frac{k_3}{k_2^{3/2}}=

    """Compute the kurtosis (Fisher or Pearson) of a dataset.

    Kurtosis is the fourth central moment divided by the square of the
    variance. If Fisher's definition is used, then 3.0 is subtracted from

    If bias is False then the kurtosis is calculated using k statistics to

    Use `kurtosistest` to see if result is close enough to normal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array
        Data for which the kurtosis is calculated.

    Examples
    --------
    In Fisher's definition, the kurtosis of the normal distribution is zero.
    In the following example, the kurtosis is close to zero, because it was
    calculated from the dataset, not from the continuous distribution.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import norm, kurtosis
    >>> data = norm.rvs(size=1000, random_state=3)
    >>> kurtosis(data)
    -0.06928694200380558

    The distribution with a higher kurtosis has a heavier tail.
    The zero valued kurtosis of the normal distribution in Fisher's definition
    can serve as a reference point.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> from scipy.stats import kurtosis

    >>> x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()

    ...     ax.plot(x, y, label="{}, {}".format(distname, round(kur, 3)))
    ...     ax.legend()

    The Laplace distribution has a heavier tail than the normal distribution.
    The uniform distribution (which has negative kurtosis) has the thinnest
    tail.

    """Calculate the score at a given percentile of the input sequence.

    For example, the score at ``per=50`` is the median. If the desired quantile
    lies between two data points, we interpolate between them, according to
    the value of `interpolation`. If the parameter `limit` is provided, it
    should be a tuple (lower, upper) of two values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        A 1-D array of values from which to extract score.
    per : array_like
        Percentile(s) at which to extract score.  Values should be in range
        [0,100].
    limit : tuple, optional
        Tuple of two scalars, the lower and upper limits within which to
        compute the percentile. Values of `a` outside
        this (closed) interval will be ignored.
    interpolation_method : {'fraction', 'lower', 'higher'}, optional
        Specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`
        The following options are available (default is 'fraction'):

          * 'fraction': ``i + (j - i) * fraction`` where ``fraction`` is the
            fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i`` and ``j``
          * 'lower': ``i``
          * 'higher': ``j``

    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the percentiles are computed. Default is None. If
        None, compute over the whole array `a`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function will become obsolete in the future.
    For NumPy 1.9 and higher, `numpy.percentile` provides all the functionality
    that `scoreatpercentile` provides.  And it's significantly faster.
    Therefore it's recommended to use `numpy.percentile` for users that have
    numpy >= 1.9.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> a = np.arange(100)

    ties, the exact definition depends on the optional keyword, `kind`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        A 1-D array to which `score` is compared.
    score : array_like
        Scores to compute percentiles for.
    kind : {'rank', 'weak', 'strict', 'mean'}, optional
        Specifies the interpretation of the resulting score.
        The following options are available (default is 'rank'):

          * 'rank': Average percentage ranking of score.  In case of multiple
            matches, average the percentage rankings of all matching scores.
          * 'weak': This kind corresponds to the definition of a cumulative

          * 'strict': Similar to "weak", except that only values that are
            strictly less than the given score are counted.
          * 'mean': The average of the "weak" and "strict" scores, often used
            in testing.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile_rank
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional

    Display the histogram of the samples standardized by the classical zscore.
    Distribution is rescaled but its shape is unchanged.

    Calculate the relative z-scores.

    Return an array of z-scores, i.e., scores that are standardized to
    zero mean and unit variance, where mean and variance are calculated

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores : array_like
        The input for which z-scores are calculated.
    compare : array_like
        The input from which the mean and standard deviation of the
        normalization are taken; assumed to have the same dimension as
        `scores`.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis over which mean and variance of `compare` are calculated.
        Default is 0. If None, compute over the whole array `scores`.
    ddof : int, optional
        Degrees of freedom correction in the calculation of the
        standard deviation. Default is 0.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle the occurrence of nans in `compare`.
        'propagate' returns nan, 'raise' raises an exception, 'omit'
        performs the calculations ignoring nan values. Default is
        'propagate'. Note that when the value is 'omit', nans in `scores`
        also propagate to the output, but they do not affect the z-scores

    This function preserves ndarray subclasses, and works also with

def gstd(a, axis=..., ddof=...): # -> Any:
    r"""
    Calculate the geometric standard deviation of an array.

    The geometric standard deviation describes the spread of a set of numbers
    where the geometric mean is preferred. It is a multiplicative factor, and
    so a dimensionless quantity.

    It is defined as the exponential of the standard deviation of the
    natural logarithms of the observations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        An array containing finite, strictly positive, real numbers.

        .. deprecated:: 1.14.0
            Support for masked array input was deprecated in
            SciPy 1.14.0 and will be removed in version 1.16.0.

    axis : int, tuple or None, optional
        Axis along which to operate. Default is 0. If None, compute over
        the whole array `a`.
    ddof : int, optional
        Degree of freedom correction in the calculation of the
        geometric standard deviation. Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    gstd : ndarray or float
        An array of the geometric standard deviation. If `axis` is None or `a`
        is a 1d array a float is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    gmean : Geometric mean
    numpy.std : Standard deviation
    gzscore : Geometric standard score

    Notes
    -----
    Mathematically, the sample geometric standard deviation :math:`s_G` can be
    defined in terms of the natural logarithms of the observations
    :math:`y_i = \log(x_i)`:

    .. math::

        s_G = \exp(s), \quad s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - d} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar y)^2}

    where :math:`n` is the number of observations, :math:`d` is the adjustment `ddof`
    to the degrees of freedom, and :math:`\bar y` denotes the mean of the natural
    logarithms of the observations. Note that the default ``ddof=1`` is different from
    the default value used by similar functions, such as `numpy.std` and `numpy.var`.

    When an observation is infinite, the geometric standard deviation is
    NaN (undefined). Non-positive observations will also produce NaNs in the
    output because the *natural* logarithm (as opposed to the *complex*
    logarithm) is defined and finite only for positive reals.
    The geometric standard deviation is sometimes confused with the exponential
    of the standard deviation, ``exp(std(a))``. Instead, the geometric standard
    deviation is ``exp(std(log(a)))``.

    Compute the interquartile range of the data along the specified axis.

    The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the 75th and
    25th percentile of the data. It is a measure of the dispersion
    similar to standard deviation or variance, but is much more robust
    against outliers [2]_.

    The ``rng`` parameter allows this function to compute other
    percentile ranges than the actual IQR. For example, setting
    ``rng=(0, 100)`` is equivalent to `numpy.ptp`.

    The IQR of an empty array is `np.nan`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int or sequence of int, optional
        Axis along which the range is computed. The default is to
        compute the IQR for the entire array.
    rng : Two-element sequence containing floats in range of [0,100] optional
        Percentiles over which to compute the range. Each must be
        between 0 and 100, inclusive. The default is the true IQR:
        ``(25, 75)``. The order of the elements is not important.
    scale : scalar or str or array_like of reals, optional
        The numerical value of scale will be divided out of the final
        result. The following string value is also recognized:

          * 'normal' : Scale by
            :math:`2 \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 1.349`.

        The default is 1.0.
        Array-like `scale` of real dtype is also allowed, as long
        as it broadcasts correctly to the output such that
        ``out / scale`` is a valid operation. The output dimensions
        depend on the input array, `x`, the `axis` argument, and the
        `keepdims` flag.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values
    interpolation : str, optional

        Specifies the interpolation method to use when the percentile
        boundaries lie between two data points ``i`` and ``j``.
        The following options are available (default is 'linear'):

          * 'linear': ``i + (j - i)*fraction``, where ``fraction`` is the
            fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i`` and ``j``.
          * 'lower': ``i``.
          * 'higher': ``j``.
          * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j`` whichever is nearest.
          * 'midpoint': ``(i + j)/2``.

        For NumPy >= 1.22.0, the additional options provided by the ``method``
        keyword of `numpy.percentile` are also valid.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the reduced axes are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the original array `x`.

    Returns
    -------
    iqr : scalar or ndarray
        If ``axis=None``, a scalar is returned. If the input contains
        integers or floats of smaller precision than ``np.float64``, then the
        output data-type is ``np.float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is
        the same as that of the input.

    r"""
    Compute the median absolute deviation of the data along the given axis.

    The median absolute deviation (MAD, [1]_) computes the median over the
    absolute deviations from the median. It is a measure of dispersion
    similar to the standard deviation but more robust to outliers [2]_.

    The MAD of an empty array is ``np.nan``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which the range is computed. Default is 0. If None, compute
        the MAD over the entire array.
    center : callable, optional
        A function that will return the central value. The default is to use
        np.median. Any user defined function used will need to have the
        function signature ``func(arr, axis)``.
    scale : scalar or str, optional
        The numerical value of scale will be divided out of the final
        result. The default is 1.0. The string "normal" is also accepted,
        and results in `scale` being the inverse of the standard normal
        quantile function at 0.75, which is approximately 0.67449.
        Array-like scale is also allowed, as long as it broadcasts correctly
        to the output such that ``out / scale`` is a valid operation. The
        output dimensions depend on the input array, `x`, and the `axis`
        argument.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

        * 'propagate': returns nan
        * 'raise': throws an error
        * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    Returns
    -------
    mad : scalar or ndarray
        If ``axis=None``, a scalar is returned. If the input contains
        integers or floats of smaller precision than ``np.float64``, then the
        output data-type is ``np.float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is
        the same as that of the input.

    scipy.stats.tstd, scipy.stats.tvar

    Notes
    -----
    The `center` argument only affects the calculation of the central value
    around which the MAD is calculated. That is, passing in ``center=np.mean``
    will calculate the MAD around the mean - it will not calculate the *mean*
    absolute deviation.

    The input array may contain `inf`, but if `center` returns `inf`, the
    corresponding MAD for that data will be `nan`.

    Examples
    --------
    When comparing the behavior of `median_abs_deviation` with ``np.std``,
    the latter is affected when we change a single value of an array to have an

def trim_mean(a, proportiontocut, axis=...): # -> float | Any:
    """Return mean of array after trimming a specified fraction of extreme values

    Removes the specified proportion of elements from *each* end of the
    sorted array, then computes the mean of the remaining elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    proportiontocut : float
        Fraction of the most positive and most negative elements to remove.
        When the specified proportion does not result in an integer number of
        elements, the number of elements to trim is rounded down.
    axis : int or None, default: 0
        Axis along which the trimmed means are computed.
        If None, compute over the raveled array.

    Returns
    -------
    trim_mean : ndarray
        Mean of trimmed array.

    tmean : Compute the mean after trimming values outside specified limits.

    Notes
    -----
    For 1-D array `a`, `trim_mean` is approximately equivalent to the following
    calculation::

        import numpy as np
        a = np.sort(a)
        m = int(proportiontocut * len(a))
        np.mean(a[m: len(a) - m])

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 5]
    >>> stats.trim_mean(x, 0.25)
    2.5

    When the specified proportion does not result in an integer number of
    elements, the number of elements to trim is rounded down.

    >>> stats.trim_mean(x, 0.24999) == np.mean(x)
    True

    Use `axis` to specify the axis along which the calculation is performed.

    >>> x2 = [[1, 2, 3, 5],

    The one-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that two or more groups have

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1, sample2, ... : array_like
        The sample measurements for each group.  There must be at least
        two arguments.  If the arrays are multidimensional, then all the

    Warns
    -----
    `~scipy.stats.ConstantInputWarning`
        Emitted if all values within each of the input arrays are identical.
        In this case the F statistic is either infinite or isn't defined,
        so ``np.inf`` or ``np.nan`` is returned.

    RuntimeWarning
        Emitted if the length of any input array is 0, or if all the input
        arrays have length 1.  ``np.nan`` is returned for the F statistic
        and the p-value in these cases.

    Notes
    -----
    The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order
    for the associated p-value to be valid.

    1. The samples are independent.
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population.
    3. The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal.  This
       property is known as homoscedasticity.

    If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still
    be possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test (`scipy.stats.kruskal`) or
    the Alexander-Govern test (`scipy.stats.alexandergovern`) although with
    some loss of power.

    The length of each group must be at least one, and there must be at
    least one group with length greater than one.  If these conditions
    are not satisfied, a warning is generated and (``np.nan``, ``np.nan``)
    is returned.

    If all values in each group are identical, and there exist at least two
    groups with different values, the function generates a warning and
    returns (``np.inf``, 0).

    If all values in all groups are the same, function generates a warning
    and returns (``np.nan``, ``np.nan``).

    Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value for testing non-correlation.

    The Pearson correlation coefficient [1]_ measures the linear relationship
    between two datasets. Like other correlation
    coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no
    correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear relationship.
    Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative
    correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.

    This function also performs a test of the null hypothesis that the
    distributions underlying the samples are uncorrelated and normally
    distributed. (See Kowalski [3]_
    for a discussion of the effects of non-normality of the input on the
    distribution of the correlation coefficient.)
    The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.
    y : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int or None, default

        If None, ravel both arrays before performing the calculation.

        .. versionadded:: 1.13.0
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'greater', 'less'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        confidence_interval(confidence_level, method)
            This computes the confidence interval of the correlation
            coefficient `statistic` for the given confidence level.
            The confidence interval is returned in a ``namedtuple`` with

            In some cases, confidence limits may be NaN due to a degenerate

        is not defined in this case, so ``np.nan`` is returned.

    `~scipy.stats.NearConstantInputWarning`
        Raised if an input is "nearly" constant.  The array ``x`` is considered
        nearly constant if ``norm(x - mean(x)) < 1e-13 * abs(mean(x))``.
        Numerical errors in the calculation ``x - mean(x)`` in this case might
        result in an inaccurate calculation of r.

    spearmanr : Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient.
    kendalltau : Kendall's tau, a correlation measure for ordinal data.

    Notes
    -----
    The correlation coefficient is calculated as follows:

    .. math::

        r = \frac{\sum (x - m_x) (y - m_y)}
                 {\sqrt{\sum (x - m_x)^2 \sum (y - m_y)^2}}

    where :math:`m_x` is the mean of the vector x and :math:`m_y` is
    the mean of the vector y.

    Under the assumption that x and y are drawn from
    independent normal distributions (so the population correlation coefficient
    is 0), the probability density function of the sample correlation
    coefficient r is ([1]_, [2]_):

    .. math::
        f(r) = \frac{{(1-r^2)}^{n/2-2}}{\mathrm{B}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{n}{2}-1)}

    where n is the number of samples, and B is the beta function.  This
    is sometimes referred to as the exact distribution of r.  This is
    the distribution that is used in `pearsonr` to compute the p-value when
    the `method` parameter is left at its default value (None).
    The distribution is a beta distribution on the interval [-1, 1],
    with equal shape parameters a = b = n/2 - 1.  In terms of SciPy's
    implementation of the beta distribution, the distribution of r is::

        dist = scipy.stats.beta(n/2 - 1, n/2 - 1, loc=-1, scale=2)

    The default p-value returned by `pearsonr` is a two-sided p-value. For a
    given sample with correlation coefficient r, the p-value is
    the probability that abs(r') of a random sample x' and y' drawn from
    the population with zero correlation would be greater than or equal
    to abs(r). In terms of the object ``dist`` shown above, the p-value
    for a given r and length n can be computed as::

        p = 2*dist.cdf(-abs(r))

    When n is 2, the above continuous distribution is not well-defined.
    One can interpret the limit of the beta distribution as the shape
    parameters a and b approach a = b = 0 as a discrete distribution with
    equal probability masses at r = 1 and r = -1.  More directly, one
    can observe that, given the data x = [x1, x2] and y = [y1, y2], and
    assuming x1 != x2 and y1 != y2, the only possible values for r are 1
    and -1.  Because abs(r') for any sample x' and y' with length 2 will
    be 1, the two-sided p-value for a sample of length 2 is always 1.

    For backwards compatibility, the object that is returned also behaves
    like a tuple of length two that holds the statistic and the p-value.

    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> x, y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [10, 9, 2.5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
    >>> res = stats.pearsonr(x, y)
    >>> res
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.828503883588428, pvalue=0.021280260007523286)

    To perform an exact permutation version of the test:

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(7796654889291491997)
    >>> method = stats.PermutationMethod(n_resamples=np.inf, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y, method=method)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.828503883588428, pvalue=0.028174603174603175)

    To perform the test under the null hypothesis that the data were drawn from
    *uniform* distributions:

    >>> method = stats.MonteCarloMethod(rvs=(rng.uniform, rng.uniform))
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y, method=method)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.828503883588428, pvalue=0.0188)

    To produce an asymptotic 90% confidence interval:

    >>> res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.9)
    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.9644331982722841, high=-0.3460237473272273)

    And for a bootstrap confidence interval:

    >>> method = stats.BootstrapMethod(method='BCa', rng=rng)
    >>> res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.9, method=method)
    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.9983163756488651, high=-0.22771001702132443)  # may vary

    If N-dimensional arrays are provided, multiple tests are performed in a
    single call according to the same conventions as most `scipy.stats` functions:

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(2348246935601934321)
    >>> x = rng.standard_normal((8, 15))
    >>> y = rng.standard_normal((8, 15))
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y, axis=0).statistic.shape  # between corresponding columns
    (15,)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y, axis=1).statistic.shape  # between corresponding rows
    (8,)

    To perform all pairwise comparisons between slices of the arrays,
    use standard NumPy broadcasting techniques. For instance, to compute the
    correlation between all pairs of rows:

    >>> stats.pearsonr(x[:, np.newaxis, :], y, axis=-1).statistic.shape
    (8, 8)

    There is a linear dependence between x and y if y = a + b*x + e, where
    a,b are constants and e is a random error term, assumed to be independent
    of x. For simplicity, assume that x is standard normal, a=0, b=1 and let
    e follow a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation s>0.

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> s = 0.5
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500, random_state=rng)
    >>> e = stats.norm.rvs(scale=s, size=500, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = x + e
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y).statistic
    0.9001942438244763

    This should be close to the exact value given by

    >>> 1/np.sqrt(1 + s**2)
    0.8944271909999159

    For s=0.5, we observe a high level of correlation. In general, a large
    variance of the noise reduces the correlation, while the correlation
    approaches one as the variance of the error goes to zero.

    It is important to keep in mind that no correlation does not imply
    independence unless (x, y) is jointly normal. Correlation can even be zero
    when there is a very simple dependence structure: if X follows a
    standard normal distribution, let y = abs(x). Note that the correlation
    between x and y is zero. Indeed, since the expectation of x is zero,
    cov(x, y) = E[x*y]. By definition, this equals E[x*abs(x)] which is zero
    by symmetry. The following lines of code illustrate this observation:

    >>> y = np.abs(x)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.05444919272687482, pvalue=0.22422294836207743)

    A non-zero correlation coefficient can be misleading. For example, if X has
    a standard normal distribution, define y = x if x < 0 and y = 0 otherwise.
    A simple calculation shows that corr(x, y) = sqrt(2/Pi) = 0.797...,
    implying a high level of correlation:

    >>> y = np.where(x < 0, x, 0)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=0.861985781588, pvalue=4.813432002751103e-149)

    This is unintuitive since there is no dependence of x and y if x is larger
    than zero which happens in about half of the cases if we sample x and y.

        The following options are available (default is 'two-sided'):

        * 'two-sided': the odds ratio of the underlying population is not one
        * 'less': the odds ratio of the underlying population is less than one
        * 'greater': the odds ratio of the underlying population is greater
          than one

    Notes
    -----
    *Null hypothesis and p-values*

    The null hypothesis is that the true odds ratio of the populations
    underlying the observations is one, and the observations were sampled at
    random from these populations under a condition: the marginals of the
    resulting table must equal those of the observed table. Equivalently,
    the null hypothesis is that the input table is from the hypergeometric
    distribution with parameters (as used in `hypergeom`)
    ``M = a + b + c + d``, ``n = a + b`` and ``N = a + c``, where the
    input table is ``[[a, b], [c, d]]``.  This distribution has support
    ``max(0, N + n - M) <= x <= min(N, n)``, or, in terms of the values
    in the input table, ``min(0, a - d) <= x <= a + min(b, c)``.  ``x``
    can be interpreted as the upper-left element of a 2x2 table, so the
    tables in the distribution have form::

        [  x           n - x     ]
        [N - x    M - (n + N) + x]

    For example, if::

        table = [6  2]
                [1  4]

    then the support is ``2 <= x <= 7``, and the tables in the distribution
    are::

        [2 6]   [3 5]   [4 4]   [5 3]   [6 2]  [7 1]
        [5 0]   [4 1]   [3 2]   [2 3]   [1 4]  [0 5]

    The probability of each table is given by the hypergeometric distribution
    ``hypergeom.pmf(x, M, n, N)``.  For this example, these are (rounded to
    three significant digits)::

        x       2      3      4      5       6        7
        p  0.0163  0.163  0.408  0.326  0.0816  0.00466

    These can be computed with::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.stats import hypergeom
        >>> table = np.array([[6, 2], [1, 4]])
        >>> M = table.sum()
        >>> n = table[0].sum()
        >>> N = table[:, 0].sum()
        >>> start, end = hypergeom.support(M, n, N)
        >>> hypergeom.pmf(np.arange(start, end+1), M, n, N)
        array([0.01631702, 0.16317016, 0.40792541, 0.32634033, 0.08158508,
               0.004662  ])

    The two-sided p-value is the probability that, under the null hypothesis,
    a random table would have a probability equal to or less than the
    probability of the input table.  For our example, the probability of
    the input table (where ``x = 6``) is 0.0816.  The x values where the
    probability does not exceed this are 2, 6 and 7, so the two-sided p-value
    is ``0.0163 + 0.0816 + 0.00466 ~= 0.10256``::

        >>> from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='two-sided')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.10256410256410257

    The one-sided p-value for ``alternative='greater'`` is the probability
    that a random table has ``x >= a``, which in our example is ``x >= 6``,
    or ``0.0816 + 0.00466 ~= 0.08626``::

        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='greater')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.08624708624708627

    This is equivalent to computing the survival function of the
    distribution at ``x = 5`` (one less than ``x`` from the input table,
    because we want to include the probability of ``x = 6`` in the sum)::

        >>> hypergeom.sf(5, M, n, N)
        0.08624708624708627

    For ``alternative='less'``, the one-sided p-value is the probability
    that a random table has ``x <= a``, (i.e. ``x <= 6`` in our example),
    or ``0.0163 + 0.163 + 0.408 + 0.326 + 0.0816 ~= 0.9949``::

        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='less')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.9953379953379957

    This is equivalent to computing the cumulative distribution function
    of the distribution at ``x = 6``:

        >>> hypergeom.cdf(6, M, n, N)
        0.9953379953379957

    *Odds ratio*

    The calculated odds ratio is different from the value computed by the
    R function ``fisher.test``.  This implementation returns the "sample"
    or "unconditional" maximum likelihood estimate, while ``fisher.test``
    in R uses the conditional maximum likelihood estimate.  To compute the
    conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio, use
    `scipy.stats.contingency.odds_ratio`.

def spearmanr(a, b=..., axis=..., nan_policy=..., alternative=...): # -> _:
    r"""Calculate a Spearman correlation coefficient with associated p-value.

    The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure
    of the monotonicity of the relationship between two datasets.
    Like other correlation coefficients,
    this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation.
    Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact monotonic relationship. Positive
    correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations
    imply that as x increases, y decreases.

    The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Spearman correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets. Although calculation of the
    p-value does not make strong assumptions about the distributions underlying
    the samples, it is only accurate for very large samples (>500
    observations). For smaller sample sizes, consider a permutation test (see
    Examples section below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : 1D or 2D array_like, b is optional
        One or two 1-D or 2-D arrays containing multiple variables and
        observations. When these are 1-D, each represents a vector of
        observations of a single variable. For the behavior in the 2-D case,
        see under ``axis``, below.
        Both arrays need to have the same length in the ``axis`` dimension.
    axis : int or None, optional
        If axis=0 (default), then each column represents a variable, with
        observations in the rows. If axis=1, the relationship is transposed:
        each row represents a variable, while the columns contain observations.
        If axis=None, then both arrays will be raveled.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

        * 'propagate': returns nan
        * 'raise': throws an error
        * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the correlation is positive (greater than zero)

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float or ndarray (2-D square)
            Spearman correlation matrix or correlation coefficient (if only 2
            variables are given as parameters). Correlation matrix is square
            with length equal to total number of variables (columns or rows) in
            ``a`` and ``b`` combined.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis
            is that two samples have no ordinal correlation. See
            `alternative` above for alternative hypotheses. `pvalue` has the
            same shape as `statistic`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `axis` is not 0, 1 or None, or if the number of dimensions of `a`
        is greater than 2, or if `b` is None and the number of dimensions of
        `a` is less than 2.

    Warns
    -----
    `~scipy.stats.ConstantInputWarning`
        Raised if an input is a constant array.  The correlation coefficient
        is not defined in this case, so ``np.nan`` is returned.

def pointbiserialr(x, y): # -> _:
    r"""Calculate a point biserial correlation coefficient and its p-value.

    The point biserial correlation is used to measure the relationship
    between a binary variable, x, and a continuous variable, y. Like other
    correlation coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0
    implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply a determinative
    relationship.

    This function may be computed using a shortcut formula but produces the
    same result as `pearsonr`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like of bools
        Input array.
    y : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    res: SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
            The R value.
        pvalue : float
            The two-sided p-value.

    Notes
    -----
    `pointbiserialr` uses a t-test with ``n-1`` degrees of freedom.
    It is equivalent to `pearsonr`.

    The value of the point-biserial correlation can be calculated from:

    .. math::

        r_{pb} = \frac{\overline{Y_1} - \overline{Y_0}}
                      {s_y}
                 \sqrt{\frac{N_0 N_1}
                            {N (N - 1)}}

    Where :math:`\overline{Y_{0}}` and :math:`\overline{Y_{1}}` are means
    of the metric observations coded 0 and 1 respectively; :math:`N_{0}` and
    :math:`N_{1}` are number of observations coded 0 and 1 respectively;
    :math:`N` is the total number of observations and :math:`s_{y}` is the
    standard deviation of all the metric observations.

    A value of :math:`r_{pb}` that is significantly different from zero is
    completely equivalent to a significant difference in means between the two
    groups. Thus, an independent groups t Test with :math:`N-2` degrees of
    freedom may be used to test whether :math:`r_{pb}` is nonzero. The
    relation between the t-statistic for comparing two independent groups and
    :math:`r_{pb}` is given by:

    .. math::

        t = \sqrt{N - 2}\frac{r_{pb}}{\sqrt{1 - r^{2}_{pb}}}

def kendalltau(x, y, *, nan_policy=..., method=..., variant=..., alternative=...): # -> _:
    r"""Calculate Kendall's tau, a correlation measure for ordinal data.

    Kendall's tau is a measure of the correspondence between two rankings.
    Values close to 1 indicate strong agreement, and values close to -1
    indicate strong disagreement. This implements two variants of Kendall's
    tau: tau-b (the default) and tau-c (also known as Stuart's tau-c). These
    differ only in how they are normalized to lie within the range -1 to 1;
    the hypothesis tests (their p-values) are identical. Kendall's original
    tau-a is not implemented separately because both tau-b and tau-c reduce
    to tau-a in the absence of ties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of rankings, of the same shape. If arrays are not 1-D, they
        will be flattened to 1-D.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

        * 'propagate': returns nan
        * 'raise': throws an error
        * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    method : {'auto', 'asymptotic', 'exact'}, optional
        Defines which method is used to calculate the p-value [5]_.
        The following options are available (default is 'auto'):

        * 'auto': selects the appropriate method based on a trade-off
          between speed and accuracy
        * 'asymptotic': uses a normal approximation valid for large samples
        * 'exact': computes the exact p-value, but can only be used if no ties
          are present. As the sample size increases, the 'exact' computation
          time may grow and the result may lose some precision.

    variant : {'b', 'c'}, optional
        Defines which variant of Kendall's tau is returned. Default is 'b'.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the rank correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the rank correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater': the rank correlation is positive (greater than zero)

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
           The tau statistic.
        pvalue : float
           The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis is
           an absence of association, tau = 0.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `nan_policy` is 'omit' and `variant` is not 'b' or
        if `method` is 'exact' and there are ties between `x` and `y`.

    Notes
    -----
    The definition of Kendall's tau that is used is [2]_::

      tau_b = (P - Q) / sqrt((P + Q + T) * (P + Q + U))

      tau_c = 2 (P - Q) / (n**2 * (m - 1) / m)

    where P is the number of concordant pairs, Q the number of discordant
    pairs, T the number of ties only in `x`, and U the number of ties only in
    `y`.  If a tie occurs for the same pair in both `x` and `y`, it is not
    added to either T or U. n is the total number of samples, and m is the
    number of unique values in either `x` or `y`, whichever is smaller.

def weightedtau(x, y, rank=..., weigher=..., additive=...): # -> _:
    r"""Compute a weighted version of Kendall's :math:`\tau`.

    The weighted :math:`\tau` is a weighted version of Kendall's
    :math:`\tau` in which exchanges of high weight are more influential than
    exchanges of low weight. The default parameters compute the additive
    hyperbolic version of the index, :math:`\tau_\mathrm h`, which has
    been shown to provide the best balance between important and
    unimportant elements [1]_.

    The weighting is defined by means of a rank array, which assigns a
    nonnegative rank to each element (higher importance ranks being
    associated with smaller values, e.g., 0 is the highest possible rank),
    and a weigher function, which assigns a weight based on the rank to
    each element. The weight of an exchange is then the sum or the product
    of the weights of the ranks of the exchanged elements. The default
    parameters compute :math:`\tau_\mathrm h`: an exchange between
    elements with rank :math:`r` and :math:`s` (starting from zero) has
    weight :math:`1/(r+1) + 1/(s+1)`.

    Specifying a rank array is meaningful only if you have in mind an
    external criterion of importance. If, as it usually happens, you do
    not have in mind a specific rank, the weighted :math:`\tau` is
    defined by averaging the values obtained using the decreasing
    lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) and by (`y`, `x`). This is the
    behavior with default parameters. Note that the convention used
    here for ranking (lower values imply higher importance) is opposite
    to that used by other SciPy statistical functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of scores, of the same shape. If arrays are not 1-D, they will
        be flattened to 1-D.
    rank : array_like of ints or bool, optional
        A nonnegative rank assigned to each element. If it is None, the
        decreasing lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) will be used: elements of
        higher rank will be those with larger `x`-values, using `y`-values to
        break ties (in particular, swapping `x` and `y` will give a different
        result). If it is False, the element indices will be used
        directly as ranks. The default is True, in which case this
        function returns the average of the values obtained using the
        decreasing lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) and by (`y`, `x`).
    weigher : callable, optional
        The weigher function. Must map nonnegative integers (zero
        representing the most important element) to a nonnegative weight.
        The default, None, provides hyperbolic weighing, that is,
        rank :math:`r` is mapped to weight :math:`1/(r+1)`.
    additive : bool, optional
        If True, the weight of an exchange is computed by adding the
        weights of the ranks of the exchanged elements; otherwise, the weights
        are multiplied. The default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    res: SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
           The weighted :math:`\tau` correlation index.
        pvalue : float
           Presently ``np.nan``, as the null distribution of the statistic is
           unknown (even in the additive hyperbolic case).

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses an :math:`O(n \log n)`, mergesort-based algorithm
    [1]_ that is a weighted extension of Knight's algorithm for Kendall's
    :math:`\tau` [2]_. It can compute Shieh's weighted :math:`\tau` [3]_
    between rankings without ties (i.e., permutations) by setting
    `additive` and `rank` to False, as the definition given in [1]_ is a
    generalization of Shieh's.

    NaNs are considered the smallest possible score.

    Notes
    -----
    The statistic is calculated as ``(np.mean(a) - popmean)/se``, where
    ``se`` is the standard error. Therefore, the statistic will be positive
    when the sample mean is greater than the population mean and negative when
    the sample mean is less than the population mean.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that the mean of a population
    is equal to 0.5. We choose a confidence level of 99%; that is, we will
    reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the p-value is
    less than 0.01.

    When testing random variates from the standard uniform distribution, which
    has a mean of 0.5, we expect the data to be consistent with the null
    hypothesis most of the time.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> rvs = stats.uniform.rvs(size=50, random_state=rng)

    TtestResult(statistic=2.456308468440, pvalue=0.017628209047638, df=49)

    As expected, the p-value of 0.017 is not below our threshold of 0.01, so
    we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

    When testing data from the standard *normal* distribution, which has a mean
    of 0, we would expect the null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=50, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5)
    TtestResult(statistic=-7.433605518875, pvalue=1.416760157221e-09, df=49)

    Indeed, the p-value is lower than our threshold of 0.01, so we reject the
    null hypothesis in favor of the default "two-sided" alternative: the mean
    of the population is *not* equal to 0.5.

    However, suppose we were to test the null hypothesis against the
    one-sided alternative that the mean of the population is *greater* than
    0.5. Since the mean of the standard normal is less than 0.5, we would not
    expect the null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5, alternative='greater')
    TtestResult(statistic=-7.433605518875, pvalue=0.99999999929, df=49)

    Unsurprisingly, with a p-value greater than our threshold, we would not
    reject the null hypothesis.

    Note that when working with a confidence level of 99%, a true null
    hypothesis will be rejected approximately 1% of the time.

    >>> rvs = stats.uniform.rvs(size=(100, 50), random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5, axis=1)
    >>> np.sum(res.pvalue < 0.01)
    1

    Indeed, even though all 100 samples above were drawn from the standard
    uniform distribution, which *does* have a population mean of 0.5, we would
    mistakenly reject the null hypothesis for one of them.

    `ttest_1samp` can also compute a confidence interval around the population
    mean.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=50, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0)
    >>> ci = res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)
    >>> ci
    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.3193887540880017, high=0.2898583388980972)

    The bounds of the 95% confidence interval are the
    minimum and maximum values of the parameter `popmean` for which the
    p-value of the test would be 0.05.

    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=ci.low)
    >>> np.testing.assert_allclose(res.pvalue, 0.05)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=ci.high)
    >>> np.testing.assert_allclose(res.pvalue, 0.05)

    Under certain assumptions about the population from which a sample
    is drawn, the confidence interval with confidence level 95% is expected
    to contain the true population mean in 95% of sample replications.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=(50, 1000), loc=1, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0)
    >>> ci = res.confidence_interval()
    >>> contains_pop_mean = (ci.low < 1) & (ci.high > 1)
    >>> contains_pop_mean.sum()

    r"""
    T-test for means of two independent samples from descriptive statistics.

    This is a test for the null hypothesis that two independent
    samples have identical average (expected) values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mean1 : array_like
        The mean(s) of sample 1.
    std1 : array_like
        The corrected sample standard deviation of sample 1 (i.e. ``ddof=1``).
    nobs1 : array_like
        The number(s) of observations of sample 1.
    mean2 : array_like
        The mean(s) of sample 2.
    std2 : array_like
        The corrected sample standard deviation of sample 2 (i.e. ``ddof=1``).
    nobs2 : array_like
        The number(s) of observations of sample 2.
    equal_var : bool, optional
        If True (default), perform a standard independent 2 sample test
        that assumes equal population variances [1]_.
        If False, perform Welch's t-test, which does not assume equal
        population variance [2]_.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis.
        The following options are available (default is 'two-sided'):

        * 'two-sided': the means of the distributions are unequal.
        * 'less': the mean of the first distribution is less than the
          mean of the second distribution.
        * 'greater': the mean of the first distribution is greater than the
          mean of the second distribution.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float or array
        The calculated t-statistics.
    pvalue : float or array
        The two-tailed p-value.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.stats.ttest_ind

    Notes
    -----
    The statistic is calculated as ``(mean1 - mean2)/se``, where ``se`` is the
    standard error. Therefore, the statistic will be positive when `mean1` is
    greater than `mean2` and negative when `mean1` is less than `mean2`.

    This method does not check whether any of the elements of `std1` or `std2`
    are negative. If any elements of the `std1` or `std2` parameters are
    negative in a call to this method, this method will return the same result
    as if it were passed ``numpy.abs(std1)`` and ``numpy.abs(std2)``,
    respectively, instead; no exceptions or warnings will be emitted.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we have the summary data for two samples, as follows (with the
    Sample Variance being the corrected sample variance)::

                         Sample   Sample
                   Size   Mean   Variance
        Sample 1    13    15.0     87.5
        Sample 2    11    12.0     39.0

    Apply the t-test to this data (with the assumption that the population
    variances are equal):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import ttest_ind_from_stats
    >>> ttest_ind_from_stats(mean1=15.0, std1=np.sqrt(87.5), nobs1=13,
    ...                      mean2=12.0, std2=np.sqrt(39.0), nobs2=11)
    Ttest_indResult(statistic=0.9051358093310269, pvalue=0.3751996797581487)

    For comparison, here is the data from which those summary statistics
    were taken.  With this data, we can compute the same result using
    `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13, 15, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 26])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21])
    >>> from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
    >>> ttest_ind(a, b)
    TtestResult(statistic=0.905135809331027,
                pvalue=0.3751996797581486,
                df=22.0)

    Suppose we instead have binary data and would like to apply a t-test to
    compare the proportion of 1s in two independent groups::

                          Number of    Sample     Sample
                    Size    ones        Mean     Variance
        Sample 1    150      30         0.2        0.161073
        Sample 2    200      45         0.225      0.175251

    The sample mean :math:`\hat{p}` is the proportion of ones in the sample
    and the variance for a binary observation is estimated by
    :math:`\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})`.

    >>> ttest_ind_from_stats(mean1=0.2, std1=np.sqrt(0.161073), nobs1=150,
    ...                      mean2=0.225, std2=np.sqrt(0.175251), nobs2=200)
    Ttest_indResult(statistic=-0.5627187905196761, pvalue=0.5739887114209541)

    For comparison, we could compute the t statistic and p-value using
    arrays of 0s and 1s and `scipy.stat.ttest_ind`, as above.

    >>> group1 = np.array([1]*30 + [0]*(150-30))
    >>> group2 = np.array([1]*45 + [0]*(200-45))
    >>> ttest_ind(group1, group2)
    TtestResult(statistic=-0.5627179589855622,

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        The arrays must have the same shape, except in the dimension
        corresponding to `axis` (the first, by default).
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to compute test. If None, compute over the whole
        arrays, `a`, and `b`.
    equal_var : bool, optional
        If True (default), perform a standard independent 2 sample test
        that assumes equal population variances [1]_.
        If False, perform Welch's t-test, which does not assume equal
        population variance [2]_.

        .. versionadded:: 0.11.0

    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

        The 'omit' option is not currently available for permutation tests or
        one-sided asymptotic tests.

    permutations : non-negative int, np.inf, or None (default), optional
        If 0 or None (default), use the t-distribution to calculate p-values.
        Otherwise, `permutations` is  the number of random permutations that
        will be used to estimate p-values using a permutation test. If
        `permutations` equals or exceeds the number of distinct partitions of
        the pooled data, an exact test is performed instead (i.e. each
        distinct partition is used exactly once). See Notes for details.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17.0
            `permutations` is deprecated and will be removed in SciPy 1.7.0.
            Use the `n_resamples` argument of `PermutationMethod`, instead,
            and pass the instance as the `method` argument.

    random_state : {None, int, `numpy.random.Generator`,
            `numpy.random.RandomState`}, optional

        If `seed` is None (or `np.random`), the `numpy.random.RandomState`
        singleton is used.
        If `seed` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
        seeded with `seed`.
        If `seed` is already a ``Generator`` or ``RandomState`` instance then
        that instance is used.

        Pseudorandom number generator state used to generate permutations
        (used only when `permutations` is not None).

            `random_state` is deprecated and will be removed in SciPy 1.7.0.
            Use the `rng` argument of `PermutationMethod`, instead,
            and pass the instance as the `method` argument.

    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis.
        The following options are available (default is 'two-sided'):

        * 'two-sided': the means of the distributions underlying the samples
          are unequal.
        * 'less': the mean of the distribution underlying the first sample
          is less than the mean of the distribution underlying the second
          sample.
        * 'greater': the mean of the distribution underlying the first
          sample is greater than the mean of the distribution underlying
          the second sample.

    trim : float, optional
        If nonzero, performs a trimmed (Yuen's) t-test.
        Defines the fraction of elements to be trimmed from each end of the
        input samples. If 0 (default), no elements will be trimmed from either
        side. The number of trimmed elements from each tail is the floor of the
        trim times the number of elements. Valid range is [0, .5).
    method : ResamplingMethod, optional
        Defines the method used to compute the p-value. If `method` is an
        instance of `PermutationMethod`/`MonteCarloMethod`, the p-value is
        computed using
        `scipy.stats.permutation_test`/`scipy.stats.monte_carlo_test` with the
        provided configuration options and other appropriate settings.
        Otherwise, the p-value is computed by comparing the test statistic
        against a theoretical t-distribution.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Returns
    -------
    result : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.TtestResult`
        An object with the following attributes:

        statistic : float or ndarray
            The t-statistic.
        pvalue : float or ndarray
            The p-value associated with the given alternative.
        df : float or ndarray
            The number of degrees of freedom used in calculation of the
            t-statistic. This is always NaN for a permutation t-test.

            .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

        The object also has the following method:

        confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)
            Computes a confidence interval around the difference in
            population means for the given confidence level.
            The confidence interval is returned in a ``namedtuple`` with
            fields ``low`` and ``high``.
            When a permutation t-test is performed, the confidence interval
            is not computed, and fields ``low`` and ``high`` contain NaN.

            .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

    Notes
    -----
    Suppose we observe two independent samples, e.g. flower petal lengths, and
    we are considering whether the two samples were drawn from the same
    population (e.g. the same species of flower or two species with similar
    petal characteristics) or two different populations.

    The t-test quantifies the difference between the arithmetic means
    of the two samples. The p-value quantifies the probability of observing
    as or more extreme values assuming the null hypothesis, that the
    samples are drawn from populations with the same population means, is true.
    A p-value larger than a chosen threshold (e.g. 5% or 1%) indicates that
    our observation is not so unlikely to have occurred by chance. Therefore,
    we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal population means.
    If the p-value is smaller than our threshold, then we have evidence
    against the null hypothesis of equal population means.

    By default, the p-value is determined by comparing the t-statistic of the
    observed data against a theoretical t-distribution.

    (In the following, note that the argument `permutations` itself is
    deprecated, but a nearly identical test may be performed by creating
    an instance of `scipy.stats.PermutationMethod` with ``n_resamples=permutuations``
    and passing it as the `method` argument.)
    When ``1 < permutations < binom(n, k)``, where

    * ``k`` is the number of observations in `a`,
    * ``n`` is the total number of observations in `a` and `b`, and
    * ``binom(n, k)`` is the binomial coefficient (``n`` choose ``k``),

    the data are pooled (concatenated), randomly assigned to either group `a`
    or `b`, and the t-statistic is calculated. This process is performed
    repeatedly (`permutation` times), generating a distribution of the
    t-statistic under the null hypothesis, and the t-statistic of the observed
    data is compared to this distribution to determine the p-value.
    Specifically, the p-value reported is the "achieved significance level"
    (ASL) as defined in 4.4 of [3]_. Note that there are other ways of
    estimating p-values using randomized permutation tests; for other
    options, see the more general `permutation_test`.

    When ``permutations >= binom(n, k)``, an exact test is performed: the data
    are partitioned between the groups in each distinct way exactly once.

    The permutation test can be computationally expensive and not necessarily
    more accurate than the analytical test, but it does not make strong
    assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution.

    Use of trimming is commonly referred to as the trimmed t-test. At times
    called Yuen's t-test, this is an extension of Welch's t-test, with the
    difference being the use of winsorized means in calculation of the variance
    and the trimmed sample size in calculation of the statistic. Trimming is
    recommended if the underlying distribution is long-tailed or contaminated
    with outliers [4]_.

    The statistic is calculated as ``(np.mean(a) - np.mean(b))/se``, where
    ``se`` is the standard error. Therefore, the statistic will be positive
    when the sample mean of `a` is greater than the sample mean of `b` and
    negative when the sample mean of `a` is less than the sample mean of
    `b`.

    Notes
    -----
    Examples for use are scores of the same set of student in
    different exams, or repeated sampling from the same units. The
    test measures whether the average score differs significantly
    across samples (e.g. exams). If we observe a large p-value, for
    example greater than 0.05 or 0.1 then we cannot reject the null
    hypothesis of identical average scores. If the p-value is smaller
    than the threshold, e.g. 1%, 5% or 10%, then we reject the null
    hypothesis of equal averages. Small p-values are associated with
    large t-statistics.

    The t-statistic is calculated as ``np.mean(a - b)/se``, where ``se`` is the
    standard error. Therefore, the t-statistic will be positive when the sample
    mean of ``a - b`` is greater than zero and negative when the sample mean of
    ``a - b`` is less than zero.

    Notes
    -----
    This test is invalid when the observed or expected frequencies in each
    category are too small.  A typical rule is that all of the observed
    and expected frequencies should be at least 5.

    Also, the sum of the observed and expected frequencies must be the same
    for the test to be valid; `power_divergence` raises an error if the sums
    do not agree within a relative tolerance of ``eps**0.5``, where ``eps``
    is the precision of the input dtype.

    When `lambda_` is less than zero, the formula for the statistic involves
    dividing by `f_obs`, so a warning or error may be generated if any value
    in `f_obs` is 0.

    Similarly, a warning or error may be generated if any value in `f_exp` is
    zero when `lambda_` >= 0.

    The default degrees of freedom, k-1, are for the case when no parameters
    of the distribution are estimated. If p parameters are estimated by
    efficient maximum likelihood then the correct degrees of freedom are
    k-1-p. If the parameters are estimated in a different way, then the
    dof can be between k-1-p and k-1. However, it is also possible that
    the asymptotic distribution is not a chisquare, in which case this
    test is not appropriate.

    Examples
    --------
    (See `chisquare` for more examples.)

    When just `f_obs` is given, it is assumed that the expected frequencies
    are uniform and given by the mean of the observed frequencies.  Here we
    perform a G-test (i.e. use the log-likelihood ratio statistic):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import power_divergence
    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], lambda_='log-likelihood')
    (2.006573162632538, 0.84823476779463769)

    The expected frequencies can be given with the `f_exp` argument:

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12],
    ...                  f_exp=[16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 8],
    ...                  lambda_='log-likelihood')
    (3.3281031458963746, 0.6495419288047497)

    When `f_obs` is 2-D, by default the test is applied to each column.

    >>> obs = np.array([[16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], [32, 24, 16, 28, 20, 24]]).T
    >>> obs.shape
    (6, 2)
    >>> power_divergence(obs, lambda_="log-likelihood")
    (array([ 2.00657316,  6.77634498]), array([ 0.84823477,  0.23781225]))

    By setting ``axis=None``, the test is applied to all data in the array,
    which is equivalent to applying the test to the flattened array.

    >>> power_divergence(obs, axis=None)
    (23.31034482758621, 0.015975692534127565)
    >>> power_divergence(obs.ravel())
    (23.31034482758621, 0.015975692534127565)

    `ddof` is the change to make to the default degrees of freedom.

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], ddof=1)
    (2.0, 0.73575888234288467)

    The calculation of the p-values is done by broadcasting the
    test statistic with `ddof`.

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], ddof=[0,1,2])
    (2.0, array([ 0.84914504,  0.73575888,  0.5724067 ]))

    `f_obs` and `f_exp` are also broadcast.  In the following, `f_obs` has
    shape (6,) and `f_exp` has shape (2, 6), so the result of broadcasting
    `f_obs` and `f_exp` has shape (2, 6).  To compute the desired chi-squared
    statistics, we must use ``axis=1``:

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12],
    ...                  f_exp=[[16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 8],
    ...                         [8, 20, 20, 16, 12, 12]],
    ...                  axis=1)
    (array([ 3.5 ,  9.25]), array([ 0.62338763,  0.09949846]))

    Notes
    -----
    This test is invalid when the observed or expected frequencies in each
    category are too small.  A typical rule is that all of the observed
    and expected frequencies should be at least 5. According to [2]_, the
    total number of observations is recommended to be greater than 13,
    otherwise exact tests (such as Barnard's Exact test) should be used
    because they do not overreject.

    The default degrees of freedom, k-1, are for the case when no parameters
    of the distribution are estimated. If p parameters are estimated by
    efficient maximum likelihood then the correct degrees of freedom are
    k-1-p. If the parameters are estimated in a different way, then the
    dof can be between k-1-p and k-1. However, it is also possible that
    the asymptotic distribution is not chi-square, in which case this test
    is not appropriate.

    For Pearson's chi-squared test, the total observed and expected counts must match
    for the p-value to accurately reflect the probability of observing such an extreme
    value of the statistic under the null hypothesis.
    This function may be used to perform other statistical tests that do not require
    the total counts to be equal. For instance, to test the null hypothesis that
    ``f_obs[i]`` is Poisson-distributed with expectation ``f_exp[i]``, set ``ddof=-1``
    and ``sum_check=False``. This test follows from the fact that a Poisson random
    variable with mean and variance ``f_exp[i]`` is approximately normal with the
    same mean and variance; the chi-squared statistic standardizes, squares, and sums
    the observations; and the sum of ``n`` squared standard normal variables follows
    the chi-squared distribution with ``n`` degrees of freedom.

    Examples
    --------
    When only the mandatory `f_obs` argument is given, it is assumed that the
    expected frequencies are uniform and given by the mean of the observed
    frequencies:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import chisquare
    >>> chisquare([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12])
    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=2.0, pvalue=0.84914503608460956)

    The optional `f_exp` argument gives the expected frequencies.

    >>> chisquare([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], f_exp=[16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 8])
    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=3.5, pvalue=0.62338762774958223)

    When `f_obs` is 2-D, by default the test is applied to each column.

    >>> obs = np.array([[16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], [32, 24, 16, 28, 20, 24]]).T
    >>> obs.shape

    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=array([2.        , 6.66666667]), pvalue=array([0.84914504, 0.24663415]))

    By setting ``axis=None``, the test is applied to all data in the array,
    which is equivalent to applying the test to the flattened array.

    >>> chisquare(obs, axis=None)
    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=23.31034482758621, pvalue=0.015975692534127565)

    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=23.310344827586206, pvalue=0.01597569253412758)

    `ddof` is the change to make to the default degrees of freedom.

    >>> chisquare([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], ddof=1)
    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=2.0, pvalue=0.7357588823428847)

    The calculation of the p-values is done by broadcasting the
    chi-squared statistic with `ddof`.

    >>> chisquare([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], ddof=[0, 1, 2])
    Power_divergenceResult(statistic=2.0, pvalue=array([0.84914504, 0.73575888, 0.5724067 ]))

    `f_obs` and `f_exp` are also broadcast.  In the following, `f_obs` has
    shape (6,) and `f_exp` has shape (2, 6), so the result of broadcasting
    `f_obs` and `f_exp` has shape (2, 6).  To compute the desired chi-squared
    statistics, we use ``axis=1``:

    >>> chisquare([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12],
    ...           f_exp=[[16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 8], [8, 20, 20, 16, 12, 12]],

    Notes
    -----
    There are three options for the null and corresponding alternative
    hypothesis that can be selected using the `alternative` parameter.

    - `two-sided`: The null hypothesis is that the two distributions are
      identical, F(x)=G(x) for all x; the alternative is that they are not
      identical.

    - `less`: The null hypothesis is that F(x) >= G(x) for all x; the
      alternative is that F(x) < G(x) for at least one x.

    - `greater`: The null hypothesis is that F(x) <= G(x) for all x; the
      alternative is that F(x) > G(x) for at least one x.

    Note that the alternative hypotheses describe the *CDFs* of the
    underlying distributions, not the observed values. For example,
    suppose x1 ~ F and x2 ~ G. If F(x) > G(x) for all x, the values in
    x1 tend to be less than those in x2.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that a sample is distributed
    according to the standard normal.
    We choose a confidence level of 95%; that is, we will reject the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the p-value is less than 0.05.

    When testing uniformly distributed data, we would expect the
    null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> stats.ks_1samp(stats.uniform.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng),
    ...                stats.norm.cdf)
    KstestResult(statistic=0.5001899973268688,
                 pvalue=1.1616392184763533e-23,
                 statistic_location=0.00047625268963724654,
                 statistic_sign=-1)

    Indeed, the p-value is lower than our threshold of 0.05, so we reject the
    null hypothesis in favor of the default "two-sided" alternative: the data
    are *not* distributed according to the standard normal.

    When testing random variates from the standard normal distribution, we
    expect the data to be consistent with the null hypothesis most of the time.

    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.ks_1samp(x, stats.norm.cdf)
    KstestResult(statistic=0.05345882212970396,
                 pvalue=0.9227159037744717,
                 statistic_location=-1.2451343873745018,
                 statistic_sign=1)

    As expected, the p-value of 0.92 is not below our threshold of 0.05, so
    we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

    Suppose, however, that the random variates are distributed according to
    a normal distribution that is shifted toward greater values. In this case,
    the cumulative density function (CDF) of the underlying distribution tends
    to be *less* than the CDF of the standard normal. Therefore, we would
    expect the null hypothesis to be rejected with ``alternative='less'``:

    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, loc=0.5, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.ks_1samp(x, stats.norm.cdf, alternative='less')
    KstestResult(statistic=0.17482387821055168,
                 pvalue=0.001913921057766743,
                 statistic_location=0.3713830565352756,
                 statistic_sign=-1)

    and indeed, with p-value smaller than our threshold, we reject the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

    Notes
    -----
    There are three options for the null and corresponding alternative
    hypothesis that can be selected using the `alternative` parameter.

    - `less`: The null hypothesis is that F(x) >= G(x) for all x; the
      alternative is that F(x) < G(x) for at least one x. The statistic
      is the magnitude of the minimum (most negative) difference between the
      empirical distribution functions of the samples.

    - `greater`: The null hypothesis is that F(x) <= G(x) for all x; the
      alternative is that F(x) > G(x) for at least one x. The statistic
      is the maximum (most positive) difference between the empirical
      distribution functions of the samples.

    - `two-sided`: The null hypothesis is that the two distributions are
      identical, F(x)=G(x) for all x; the alternative is that they are not
      identical. The statistic is the maximum absolute difference between the
      empirical distribution functions of the samples.

    Note that the alternative hypotheses describe the *CDFs* of the
    underlying distributions, not the observed values of the data. For example,
    suppose x1 ~ F and x2 ~ G. If F(x) > G(x) for all x, the values in
    x1 tend to be less than those in x2.

    If the KS statistic is large, then the p-value will be small, and this may
    be taken as evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the
    alternative.

    If ``method='exact'``, `ks_2samp` attempts to compute an exact p-value,
    that is, the probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining a test
    statistic value as extreme as the value computed from the data.
    If ``method='asymp'``, the asymptotic Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution is
    used to compute an approximate p-value.
    If ``method='auto'``, an exact p-value computation is attempted if both
    sample sizes are less than 10000; otherwise, the asymptotic method is used.
    In any case, if an exact p-value calculation is attempted and fails, a
    warning will be emitted, and the asymptotic p-value will be returned.

    The 'two-sided' 'exact' computation computes the complementary probability
    and then subtracts from 1.  As such, the minimum probability it can return
    is about 1e-16.  While the algorithm itself is exact, numerical
    errors may accumulate for large sample sizes.   It is most suited to
    situations in which one of the sample sizes is only a few thousand.

    We generally follow Hodges' treatment of Drion/Gnedenko/Korolyuk [1]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that two samples were drawn
    from the same distribution.
    We choose a confidence level of 95%; that is, we will reject the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the p-value is less than 0.05.

    If the first sample were drawn from a uniform distribution and the second
    were drawn from the standard normal, we would expect the null hypothesis
    to be rejected.

                 statistic_sign=-1)

    As expected, the p-value of 0.54 is not below our threshold of 0.05, so
    we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

    Suppose, however, that the first sample were drawn from
    a normal distribution shifted toward greater values. In this case,

    As expected, the p-value of 0.92 is not below our threshold of 0.05, so

                 statistic_sign=-1)

    and indeed, with p-value smaller than our threshold, we reject the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

    For convenience, the previous test can be performed using the name of the
    distribution as the second argument.

    >>> stats.kstest(x, "norm", alternative='less')

    The examples above have all been one-sample tests identical to those
    performed by `ks_1samp`. Note that `kstest` can also perform two-sample
    tests identical to those performed by `ks_2samp`. For example, when two
    samples are drawn from the same distribution, we expect the data to be
    consistent with the null hypothesis most of the time.

    As expected, the p-value of 0.45 is not below our threshold of 0.05, so

    Combine p-values from independent tests that bear upon the same hypothesis.

    These methods are intended only for combining p-values from hypothesis
    tests based upon continuous distributions.

    Each method assumes that under the null hypothesis, the p-values are
    sampled independently and uniformly from the interval [0, 1]. A test
    statistic (different for each method) is computed and a combined
    p-value is calculated based upon the distribution of this test statistic
    under the null hypothesis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvalues : array_like
        Array of p-values assumed to come from independent tests based on
        continuous distributions.
    method : {'fisher', 'pearson', 'tippett', 'stouffer', 'mudholkar_george'}

        Name of method to use to combine p-values.

        The available methods are (see Notes for details):

        * 'fisher': Fisher's method (Fisher's combined probability test)
        * 'pearson': Pearson's method
        * 'mudholkar_george': Mudholkar's and George's method
        * 'tippett': Tippett's method
        * 'stouffer': Stouffer's Z-score method
    weights : array_like, optional
        Optional array of weights used only for Stouffer's Z-score method.
        Ignored by other methods.

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
            The statistic calculated by the specified method.
        pvalue : float
            The combined p-value.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to combine p-values from four independent tests
    of the same null hypothesis using Fisher's method (default).

    >>> from scipy.stats import combine_pvalues
    >>> pvalues = [0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.3]

    SignificanceResult(statistic=20.828626352604235, pvalue=0.007616871850449092)

    When the individual p-values carry different weights, consider Stouffer's
    method.

    >>> weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> res = combine_pvalues(pvalues, method='stouffer', weights=weights)
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.009578891494533616

    Notes
    -----
    If this function is applied to tests with a discrete statistics such as
    any rank test or contingency-table test, it will yield systematically
    wrong results, e.g. Fisher's method will systematically overestimate the
    p-value [1]_. This problem becomes less severe for large sample sizes
    when the discrete distributions become approximately continuous.

    The differences between the methods can be best illustrated by their
    statistics and what aspects of a combination of p-values they emphasise
    when considering significance [2]_. For example, methods emphasising large
    p-values are more sensitive to strong false and true negatives; conversely
    methods focussing on small p-values are sensitive to positives.

    * The statistics of Fisher's method (also known as Fisher's combined
      probability test) [3]_ is :math:`-2\\sum_i \\log(p_i)`, which is
      equivalent (as a test statistics) to the product of individual p-values:
      :math:`\\prod_i p_i`. Under the null hypothesis, this statistics follows
      a :math:`\\chi^2` distribution. This method emphasises small p-values.
    * Pearson's method uses :math:`-2\\sum_i\\log(1-p_i)`, which is equivalent
      to :math:`\\prod_i \\frac{1}{1-p_i}` [2]_.
      It thus emphasises large p-values.
    * Mudholkar and George compromise between Fisher's and Pearson's method by
      averaging their statistics [4]_. Their method emphasises extreme
      p-values, both close to 1 and 0.
    * Stouffer's method [5]_ uses Z-scores and the statistic:
      :math:`\\sum_i \\Phi^{-1} (p_i)`, where :math:`\\Phi` is the CDF of the
      standard normal distribution. The advantage of this method is that it is
      straightforward to introduce weights, which can make Stouffer's method
      more powerful than Fisher's method when the p-values are from studies
      of different size [6]_ [7]_.
    * Tippett's method uses the smallest p-value as a statistic.
      (Mind that this minimum is not the combined p-value.)

    Fisher's method may be extended to combine p-values from dependent tests
    [8]_. Extensions such as Brown's method and Kost's method are not currently
    implemented.

            population quantile associated with the probability `p`. The
            confidence interval is returned in a ``namedtuple`` with
            fields `low` and `high`.  Values are `nan` when there are
            not enough observations to compute the confidence interval at
            the desired confidence.

    Notes
    -----
    This test and its method for computing confidence intervals are
    non-parametric. They are valid if and only if the observations are i.i.d.

    The implementation of the test follows Conover [1]_. Two test statistics
    are considered.

    ``T1``: The number of observations in `x` less than or equal to `q`.

        ``T1 = (x <= q).sum()``

    ``T2``: The number of observations in `x` strictly less than `q`.

        ``T2 = (x < q).sum()``

    The use of two test statistics is necessary to handle the possibility that
    `x` was generated from a discrete or mixed distribution.

    The null hypothesis for the test is:

        H0: The :math:`p^{\mathrm{th}}` population quantile is `q`.

    and the null distribution for each test statistic is
    :math:`\mathrm{binom}\left(n, p\right)`. When ``alternative='less'``,
    the alternative hypothesis is:

        H1: The :math:`p^{\mathrm{th}}` population quantile is less than `q`.

    and the p-value is the probability that the binomial random variable

    .. math::
        Y \sim \mathrm{binom}\left(n, p\right)

    is greater than or equal to the observed value ``T2``.

    When ``alternative='greater'``, the alternative hypothesis is:

        H1: The :math:`p^{\mathrm{th}}` population quantile is greater than `q`

    and the p-value is the probability that the binomial random variable Y
    is less than or equal to the observed value ``T1``.

    When ``alternative='two-sided'``, the alternative hypothesis is

        H1: `q` is not the :math:`p^{\mathrm{th}}` population quantile.

    and the p-value is twice the smaller of the p-values for the ``'less'``
    and ``'greater'`` cases. Both of these p-values can exceed 0.5 for the same
    data, so the value is clipped into the interval :math:`[0, 1]`.

    The approach for confidence intervals is attributed to Thompson [2]_ and
    later proven to be applicable to any set of i.i.d. samples [3]_. The
    computation is based on the observation that the probability of a quantile
    :math:`q` to be larger than any observations :math:`x_m (1\leq m \leq N)`
    can be computed as

    .. math::

        \mathbb{P}(x_m \leq q) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{N}{k}
        q^k(1-q)^{N-k}

    By default, confidence intervals are computed for a 95% confidence level.
    A common interpretation of a 95% confidence intervals is that if i.i.d.
    samples are drawn repeatedly from the same population and confidence
    intervals are formed each time, the confidence interval will contain the
    true value of the specified quantile in approximately 95% of trials.

    A similar function is available in the QuantileNPCI R package [4]_. The
    foundation is the same, but it computes the confidence interval bounds by
    doing interpolations between the sample values, whereas this function uses
    only sample values as bounds. Thus, ``quantile_test.confidence_interval``
    returns more conservative intervals (i.e., larger).

    The same computation of confidence intervals for quantiles is included in
    the confintr package [5]_.

    Two-sided confidence intervals are not guaranteed to be optimal; i.e.,
    there may exist a tighter interval that may contain the quantile of
    interest with probability larger than the confidence level.
    Without further assumption on the samples (e.g., the nature of the
    underlying distribution), the one-sided intervals are optimally tight.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that the median of a population
    is equal to 0.5. We choose a confidence level of 99%; that is, we will
    reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the p-value is
    less than 0.01.

    When testing random variates from the standard uniform distribution, which
    has a median of 0.5, we expect the data to be consistent with the null
    hypothesis most of the time.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(6981396440634228121)
    >>> rvs = stats.uniform.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=0.5, p=0.5)
    QuantileTestResult(statistic=45, statistic_type=1, pvalue=0.36820161732669576)

    As expected, the p-value is not below our threshold of 0.01, so
    we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

    When testing data from the standard *normal* distribution, which has a
    median of 0, we would expect the null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=0.5, p=0.5)
    QuantileTestResult(statistic=67, statistic_type=2, pvalue=0.0008737198369123724)

    Indeed, the p-value is lower than our threshold of 0.01, so we reject the
    null hypothesis in favor of the default "two-sided" alternative: the median
    of the population is *not* equal to 0.5.

    However, suppose we were to test the null hypothesis against the
    one-sided alternative that the median of the population is *greater* than
    0.5. Since the median of the standard normal is less than 0.5, we would not
    expect the null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=0.5, p=0.5, alternative='greater')
    QuantileTestResult(statistic=67, statistic_type=1, pvalue=0.9997956114162866)

    Unsurprisingly, with a p-value greater than our threshold, we would not
    reject the null hypothesis in favor of the chosen alternative.

    The quantile test can be used for any quantile, not only the median. For
    example, we can test whether the third quartile of the distribution
    underlying the sample is greater than 0.6.

    >>> rvs = stats.uniform.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=0.6, p=0.75, alternative='greater')
    QuantileTestResult(statistic=64, statistic_type=1, pvalue=0.00940696592998271)

    The p-value is lower than the threshold. We reject the null hypothesis in
    favor of the alternative: the third quartile of the distribution underlying
    our sample is greater than 0.6.

    `quantile_test` can also compute confidence intervals for any quantile.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=0.6, p=0.75)
    >>> ci = res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)
    >>> ci
    ConfidenceInterval(low=0.284491604437432, high=0.8912531024914844)

    When testing a one-sided alternative, the confidence interval contains
    all observations such that if passed as `q`, the p-value of the
    test would be greater than 0.05, and therefore the null hypothesis
    would not be rejected. For example:

    >>> rvs.sort()
    >>> q, p, alpha = 0.6, 0.75, 0.95
    >>> res = stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=q, p=p, alternative='less')
    >>> ci = res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=alpha)
    >>> for x in rvs[rvs <= ci.high]:
    ...     res = stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=x, p=p, alternative='less')
    ...     assert res.pvalue > 1-alpha
    >>> for x in rvs[rvs > ci.high]:
    ...     res = stats.quantile_test(rvs, q=x, p=p, alternative='less')
    ...     assert res.pvalue < 1-alpha

    Also, if a 95% confidence interval is repeatedly generated for random
    samples, the confidence interval will contain the true quantile value in
    approximately 95% of replications.

    >>> dist = stats.rayleigh() # our "unknown" distribution
    >>> p = 0.2
    >>> true_stat = dist.ppf(p) # the true value of the statistic
    >>> n_trials = 1000
    >>> quantile_ci_contains_true_stat = 0
    >>> for i in range(n_trials):
    ...     data = dist.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    ...     res = stats.quantile_test(data, p=p)
    ...     ci = res.confidence_interval(0.95)
    ...     if ci[0] < true_stat < ci[1]:
    ...         quantile_ci_contains_true_stat += 1
    >>> quantile_ci_contains_true_stat >= 950
    True

    This works with any distribution and any quantile, as long as the samples
    are i.i.d.

def wasserstein_distance_nd(u_values, v_values, u_weights=..., v_weights=...): # -> Any | float:
    r"""
    Compute the Wasserstein-1 distance between two N-D discrete distributions.

    The Wasserstein distance, also called the Earth mover's distance or the
    optimal transport distance, is a similarity metric between two probability
    distributions [1]_. In the discrete case, the Wasserstein distance can be
    understood as the cost of an optimal transport plan to convert one
    distribution into the other. The cost is calculated as the product of the
    amount of probability mass being moved and the distance it is being moved.
    A brief and intuitive introduction can be found at [2]_.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    u_values : 2d array_like
        A sample from a probability distribution or the support (set of all
        possible values) of a probability distribution. Each element along
        axis 0 is an observation or possible value, and axis 1 represents the
        dimensionality of the distribution; i.e., each row is a vector
        observation or possible value.

    v_values : 2d array_like
        A sample from or the support of a second distribution.

    u_weights, v_weights : 1d array_like, optional
        Weights or counts corresponding with the sample or probability masses
        corresponding with the support values. Sum of elements must be positive
        and finite. If unspecified, each value is assigned the same weight.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : float
        The computed distance between the distributions.

    Notes
    -----
    Given two probability mass functions, :math:`u`
    and :math:`v`, the first Wasserstein distance between the distributions
    using the Euclidean norm is:

    .. math::

        l_1 (u, v) = \inf_{\pi \in \Gamma (u, v)} \int \| x-y \|_2 \mathrm{d} \pi (x, y)

    where :math:`\Gamma (u, v)` is the set of (probability) distributions on
    :math:`\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n` whose marginals are :math:`u` and
    :math:`v` on the first and second factors respectively. For a given value
    :math:`x`, :math:`u(x)` gives the probability of :math:`u` at position
    :math:`x`, and the same for :math:`v(x)`.

    This is also called the optimal transport problem or the Monge problem.
    Let the finite point sets :math:`\{x_i\}` and :math:`\{y_j\}` denote
    the support set of probability mass function :math:`u` and :math:`v`
    respectively. The Monge problem can be expressed as follows,

    Let :math:`\Gamma` denote the transport plan, :math:`D` denote the
    distance matrix and,

    .. math::

        x = \text{vec}(\Gamma)          \\
        c = \text{vec}(D)               \\
        b = \begin{bmatrix}
                u\\
                v\\
            \end{bmatrix}

    The :math:`\text{vec}()` function denotes the Vectorization function
    that transforms a matrix into a column vector by vertically stacking
    the columns of the matrix.
    The transport plan :math:`\Gamma` is a matrix :math:`[\gamma_{ij}]` in
    which :math:`\gamma_{ij}` is a positive value representing the amount of
    probability mass transported from :math:`u(x_i)` to :math:`v(y_i)`.
    Summing over the rows of :math:`\Gamma` should give the source distribution
    :math:`u` : :math:`\sum_j \gamma_{ij} = u(x_i)` holds for all :math:`i`
    and summing over the columns of :math:`\Gamma` should give the target
    distribution :math:`v`: :math:`\sum_i \gamma_{ij} = v(y_j)` holds for all
    :math:`j`.
    The distance matrix :math:`D` is a matrix :math:`[d_{ij}]`, in which
    :math:`d_{ij} = d(x_i, y_j)`.

    Given :math:`\Gamma`, :math:`D`, :math:`b`, the Monge problem can be
    transformed into a linear programming problem by
    taking :math:`A x = b` as constraints and :math:`z = c^T x` as minimization
    target (sum of costs) , where matrix :math:`A` has the form

    .. math::

        \begin{array} {rrrr|rrrr|r|rrrr}
            1 & 1 & \dots & 1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots &
                0 \cr
            0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 &\dots &
                0 \cr
            \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
                & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots  \cr
            0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots & 1 & 1 & \dots &
                1 \cr \hline

            1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & \dots & \dots & 1 & 0 & \dots &
                0 \cr
            0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & \dots & \dots & 0 & 1 & \dots &
                0 \cr
            \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots &
                \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr
            0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1
        \end{array}

    By solving the dual form of the above linear programming problem (with
    solution :math:`y^*`), the Wasserstein distance :math:`l_1 (u, v)` can
    be computed as :math:`b^T y^*`.

    The above solution is inspired by Vincent Herrmann's blog [3]_ . For a
    more thorough explanation, see [4]_ .

    The input distributions can be empirical, therefore coming from samples
    whose values are effectively inputs of the function, or they can be seen as
    generalized functions, in which case they are weighted sums of Dirac delta
    functions located at the specified values.

        D(u, v) = \sqrt{2} l_2(u, v) = \left( 2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (U-V)^2
        \right)^{1/2}

    Note that the common CramÃ©r-von Mises criterion uses the distribution-free
    version of the distance. See [2]_ (section 2), for more details about both
    versions of the distance.

    The input distributions can be empirical, therefore coming from samples
    whose values are effectively inputs of the function, or they can be seen as
    generalized functions, in which case they are weighted sums of Dirac delta
    functions located at the specified values.

    By default (``axis=None``), the data array is first flattened, and a flat
    array of ranks is returned. Separately reshape the rank array to the
    shape of the data array if desired (see Examples).

    Ranks begin at 1.  The `method` argument controls how ranks are assigned

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array of values to be ranked.
    method : {'average', 'min', 'max', 'dense', 'ordinal'}, optional
        The method used to assign ranks to tied elements.
        The following methods are available (default is 'average'):

          * 'average': The average of the ranks that would have been assigned to
            all the tied values is assigned to each value.
          * 'min': The minimum of the ranks that would have been assigned to all
            the tied values is assigned to each value.  (This is also
            referred to as "competition" ranking.)
          * 'max': The maximum of the ranks that would have been assigned to all
            the tied values is assigned to each value.
          * 'dense': Like 'min', but the rank of the next highest element is
            assigned the rank immediately after those assigned to the tied
            elements.
          * 'ordinal': All values are given a distinct rank, corresponding to
            the order that the values occur in `a`.
    axis : {None, int}, optional
        Axis along which to perform the ranking. If ``None``, the data array
        is first flattened.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'omit', 'raise'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': propagates nans through the rank calculation
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values
          * 'raise': raises an error

        .. note::

            When `nan_policy` is 'propagate', the output is an array of *all*
            nans because ranks relative to nans in the input are undefined.
            When `nan_policy` is 'omit', nans in `a` are ignored when ranking
            the other values, and the corresponding locations of the output
            are nan.

def expectile(a, alpha=..., *, weights=...): # -> floating[Any]:
    r"""Compute the expectile at the specified level.

    Expectiles are a generalization of the expectation in the same way as
    quantiles are a generalization of the median. The expectile at level
    `alpha = 0.5` is the mean (average). See Notes for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose expectile is desired.
    alpha : float, default: 0.5
        The level of the expectile; e.g., ``alpha=0.5`` gives the mean.
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`.
        The `weights` must be broadcastable to the same shape as `a`.
        Default is None, which gives each value a weight of 1.0.
        An integer valued weight element acts like repeating the corresponding
        observation in `a` that many times. See Notes for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    expectile : ndarray
        The empirical expectile at level `alpha`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.mean : Arithmetic average
    numpy.quantile : Quantile

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the expectile at level :math:`\alpha` of a random variable
    :math:`X` with cumulative distribution function (CDF) :math:`F` is given
    by the unique solution :math:`t` of:

    .. math::

        \alpha E((X - t)_+) = (1 - \alpha) E((t - X)_+) \,.

    Here, :math:`(x)_+ = \max(0, x)` is the positive part of :math:`x`.
    This equation can be equivalently written as:

    .. math::

        \alpha \int_t^\infty (x - t)\mathrm{d}F(x)
        = (1 - \alpha) \int_{-\infty}^t (t - x)\mathrm{d}F(x) \,.

    The empirical expectile at level :math:`\alpha` (`alpha`) of a sample
    :math:`a_i` (the array `a`) is defined by plugging in the empirical CDF of
    `a`. Given sample or case weights :math:`w` (the array `weights`), it
    reads :math:`F_a(x) = \frac{1}{\sum_i w_i} \sum_i w_i 1_{a_i \leq x}`
    with indicator function :math:`1_{A}`. This leads to the definition of the
    empirical expectile at level `alpha` as the unique solution :math:`t` of:

    .. math::

        \alpha \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (a_i - t)_+ =
            (1 - \alpha) \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (t - a_i)_+ \,.

    For :math:`\alpha=0.5`, this simplifies to the weighted average.
    Furthermore, the larger :math:`\alpha`, the larger the value of the
    expectile.

    As a final remark, the expectile at level :math:`\alpha` can also be
    written as a minimization problem. One often used choice is

    .. math::

        \operatorname{argmin}_t
        E(\lvert 1_{t\geq X} - \alpha\rvert(t - X)^2) \,.

    The L-moments of a probability distribution are summary statistics with
    uses similar to those of conventional moments, but they are defined in
    terms of the expected values of order statistics.
    Sample L-moments are defined analogously to population L-moments, and
    they can serve as estimators of population L-moments. They tend to be less
    sensitive to extreme observations than conventional moments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : array_like
        The real-valued sample whose L-moments are desired.
    order : array_like, optional
        The (positive integer) orders of the desired L-moments.
        Must be a scalar or non-empty 1D array. Default is [1, 2, 3, 4].
    axis : int or None, default=0
        If an int, the axis of the input along which to compute the statistic.
        The statistic of each axis-slice (e.g. row) of the input will appear
        in a corresponding element of the output. If None, the input will be
        raveled before computing the statistic.
    sorted : bool, default=False
        Whether `sample` is already sorted in increasing order along `axis`.
        If False (default), `sample` will be sorted.
    standardize : bool, default=True
        Whether to return L-moment ratios for orders 3 and higher.
        L-moment ratios are analogous to standardized conventional
        moments: they are the non-standardized L-moments divided
        by the L-moment of order 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Two sets of measurements.  Both arrays should have the same length N.  If
        only `x` is given (and ``y=None``), then it must be a two-dimensional
        array where one dimension has length 2.  The two sets of measurements
        are then found by splitting the array along the length-2 dimension. In
        the case where ``y=None`` and `x` is a 2xN array, ``linregress(x)`` is
        equivalent to ``linregress(x[0], x[1])``.

        .. deprecated:: 1.14.0

        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the slope of the regression line is nonzero

        * 'greater':  the slope of the regression line is greater than zero

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    result : ``LinregressResult`` instance
        The return value is an object with the following attributes:

        slope : float
            Slope of the regression line.
        intercept : float
            Intercept of the regression line.
        rvalue : float
            The Pearson correlation coefficient. The square of ``rvalue``
            is equal to the coefficient of determination.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis is
            that the slope is zero, using Wald Test with t-distribution of
            the test statistic. See `alternative` above for alternative

            Standard error of the estimated slope (gradient), under the
            assumption of residual normality.

    Notes
    -----
    For compatibility with older versions of SciPy, the return value acts
    like a ``namedtuple`` of length 5, with fields ``slope``, ``intercept``,
    ``rvalue``, ``pvalue`` and ``stderr``, so one can continue to write::

        slope, intercept, r, p, se = linregress(x, y)

    With that style, however, the standard error of the intercept is not
    available.  To have access to all the computed values, including the
    standard error of the intercept, use the return value as an object
    with attributes, e.g.::

        result = linregress(x, y)
        print(result.intercept, result.intercept_stderr)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()

    Generate some data:

    >>> y = 1.6*x + rng.random(10)

    Perform the linear regression:

    Coefficient of determination (R-squared):

    >>> print(f"R-squared: {res.rvalue**2:.6f}")
